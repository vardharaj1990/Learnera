{"about_the_course":"In this course you will learn how to program in R and how to use R for effective data analysis. You will learn how to install and configure software necessary for a statistical programming environment, discuss generic programming language concepts as they are implemented in a high-level statistical language. The course covers practical issues in statistical computing which includes programming in R, reading data into R, creating informative data graphics, accessing R packages, creating R packages with documentation, writing R functions, debugging, and organizing and commenting R code. Topics in statistical data analysis and optimization will provide working examples.","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/compdata/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/compdata/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/compdata/large-icon.png","video":"gk6E57H6mTs","university-ids":["jhu"],"id":63,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":null,"wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"JohnsHopkins","favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/80/d81353ccd0bab30962a5770d7aec97/favicon-jhu.ico","website_facebook":"johnshopkinsuniversity","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cf/0db65d1501244b9e6eacfa5e637fea/logo-jhu-front.png","background_color":"","id":8,"location_city":"Baltimore","location_country":"US","location_lat":39.29038480000000000,"location":"Baltimore, MD","primary_color":"#0061AA","abbr_name":"Johns Hopkins","website":"http://www.jhu.edu/","description":"The mission of The Johns Hopkins University is to educate its students and cultivate their capacity for life-long learning, to foster independent and original research, and to bring the benefits of discovery to the world.","short_name":"jhu","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c2/544537cee93c0acd67b6573d46a32e/Coursera-banner.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"johnshopkins","banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/83/94437b11dcbef874ea1f30d960a26b/banner-jhu.jpg","location_state":"MD","name":"Johns Hopkins University","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f6/4798f308d4eaa66fc53e99a92d65e5/JHU_360x360.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/39/7f8dfbe935fe6b3f1eb2e85e307375/JHU_360x360.png","square_logo_svg":"","location_lng":-76.61218930000001000,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"","display":true}],"small_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/compdata/small-icon.hover.png","self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"This course is about learning the fundamental computing skills necessary for effective data analysis.
