Even technology once considered distinctly \"modern\" - photography, the telephone, movies, television - has been altered or replaced by faster and more dynamic media that allow more manipulation and control by the individual. Anyone can now create stunning photographic images without a processing lab; and film no longer earns its name, as the cinema often presents images that were never filmed to begin with, but created or doctored in the digital domain. What are the consequences of these changes for the media and arts they alter? How does digitizing affect the values, ethical and aesthetic, of images, texts, and sounds? How do these technologies change the way we spend our time and relate to other people? In the age of the digital, what becomes of property, of history, of identity? Through a series of careful comparisons of images, texts, movies, games, and music - pre-digital versus post-digital - this course will analyze the ways in which these media and our responses to them have changed in the digital era; and we will ask about the value of these changes.", "Title": "21W.784 Becoming Digital: Writing About Media Change", "CourseSection": "Writing and Humanistic Studies", "Instructors": "Prof. Aden Evens", "InstitutionNameFull": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "UniqueID": "1005610918", "DownloadPageLink": "http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/writing-and-humanistic-studies/21w-784-becoming-digital-writing-about-media-change-fall-2005/download-course-materials"}, {"TeachingDate": "", "CourseURL": "http://ocw.jhsph.edu/courses/FirstResponders/", "Description": "This unique training addresses the institutional culture of five responder groups: law enforcement, EMS, fire, public health, and private security in an attempt at fostering understanding among these groups.", "CourseLanguage": "English", "CourseSection": "Johns Hopkins Center For Public Health Preparedness", "Title": "Improving Understanding and Collaboration Among First Responders ", "Instructors": "Faculty of Johns Hopkins Center For Public Health Preparedness", "InstitutionNameFull": "Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health", "UniqueID": "1006066229", "DownloadPageLink": "http://ocw.jhsph.edu/courses/FirstResponders/lectureNotes.cfm"}, {"CourseLanguage": "English", "TeachingDate": "Fall 2004", "CourseURL": "http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/foreign-languages-and-literatures/21f-041-topics-in-south-asian-literature-and-culture-fall-2004", "Description": "This subject aims to provide an overview of contemporary texts in regional languages in South Asian Literature and Cinema.

Paying special attention to the \"theatricality\" of the new models and perspectives afforded by scientific experimentation, the class will read plays by Shakespeare, Tate, Brecht, Ford, Churchill, and Kushner, as well as primary and secondary texts from a wide range of disciplines.

In this seminar, we will read Paradise Lost alongside works of 20th century fantasy and science fiction which rethink both Milton's text and its source. \nStudents should come to the seminar having read Paradise Lost straight through at least once; this can be accomplished by taking the IAP subject, Reading Paradise Lost (21L.995), or independently. Twentieth century authors will include C. S. Lewis (Perelandra, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe) and Philip Pullman (His Dark Materials), as well as assorted criticism.

Emphasis is on the integration of fundamentals with material property estimation, process control, product development, and computer simulation. Integration of societal issues, such as engineering ethics, environmental and safety considerations, and impact of technology on society are addressed in the context of case studies.The broad context for this ICE-Topics module is the commonsense notion that, when designing something, one should plan for the off-normal conditions that may occur. A continuous process is conceived and designed as a steady-state operation. However, the process must start up, shut down, and operate in the event of disturbances, and so the time-varying behavior of the process should not be neglected. It is helpful to consider the operability of a process early in the design, when alternatives are still being compared. In this module, we will examine some tools that will help to evaluate the operability of the candidate process at the preliminary design stage, before substantial effort has been invested.", "Title": "10.492-1 Integrated Chemical Engineering Topics I: Process Control by Design", "CourseSection": "Chemical Engineering", "Instructors": "Dr. Barry S.

This online publication is a reproduction the original lecture notes for the course \"Applied Geometric Algebra\" taught by Professor Tisza in the Spring of 1976.\nOver the last 100 years, the mathematical tools employed by physicists\nhave expanded considerably, from differential calculus, vector algebra\nand geometry, to advanced linear algebra, tensors, Hilbert space,\nspinors, Group theory and many others. These sophisticated tools provide\npowerful machinery for describing the physical world, however, their\nphysical interpretation is often not intuitive. These course notes represent Prof. Tisza's attempt at bringing conceptual clarity and unity to the application and interpretation of these advanced mathematical tools. In particular, there is an emphasis on the unifying role that Group theory plays in classical, relativistic, and quantum physics. Prof. Tisza revisits many elementary problems with an advanced treatment in order to help develop the geometrical intuition for the algebraic machinery that may carry over to more advanced problems.\nThe lecture notes came to MIT OpenCourseWare by way of Samuel Gasster, '77 (Course 18), who had taken the course and kept a copy of the lecture notes for his own reference. He dedicated dozens of hours of his own time to convert the typewritten notes into LaTeX files and then publication-ready PDFs.
