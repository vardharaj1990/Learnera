{"about_the_course": "Remember the last time you went to a restaurant. What did you expect from that restaurant? You wanted to find something on the menu that you liked, you wanted the meal to be prepared according to high quality standards, you wanted to get it quickly and didn\u2019t want to pay too much money for it. Now, remember the last time you went to a doctor\u2019s office or a hospital. What did you want the doctors and nurses to do? You wanted them to provide the right care for you, you wanted the care delivered with great quality, you wanted to get the care quickly, and you (or your insurance) didn\u2019t want to &nbsp;too pay too much for it. <br><br> Put differently, the management skills that you need to run the operations of a restaurant are the same that you need to run a hospital. And these are the skills you will learn in this course. Specifically, you will learn how to improve productivity, increase responsiveness, provide more choice to the customer, and deliver higher quality standards. In short, you will learn how to analyze business processes and how to improve them. Along the way, you will learn about topics such as Lean Operations, Six Sigma, and the Toyota production system, you will hear about bottlenecks, flows rates, and inventory levels.

{"about_the_course": "We live in a world that is changing very quickly. Sociology gives us the tools to understand our own lives and those quite remote from us. The premise of this class is that in order to benefit from the sociological perspective, we need to learn how to ask certain basic questions. We need to know how to seek answers through methods that strive to be systematic and generalizable.We will begin with some of the essential questions: How are the things that we take to be natural socially constructed? How do we live today? How determined is social life? Does the individual make a difference? How is social order possible? Then we will ask what techniques are available to make sense of these questions. &nbsp;We will review comparative, historical, demographic, experimental, and ethnographic methods. Along the way, we will study core concepts including ethnocentrism, social networks, community, unanticipated consequences, social capital, race, class, and gender. <br><br> We will strive to understand how interaction in micro-level contexts affects larger social processes and how such macro-level processes influence our day to day lives. We will learn to conceive of inequality by asking how race, class, and gender work in tandem.

We will also explore how developments in&nbsp;the music business and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed.&nbsp;<br><br>Emerging out of the experimental and ambitious years of late-60s psychedelia, rock splintered into a variety of styles in the 1970s as the music business continued to expand. By the end of the decade, punk and disco had challenged the excesses of the&nbsp;hippie aesthetic, as rock became more commercially streamlined and radio friendly. The emergence and rise of MTV transformed pop music and propelled the careers of Michael jackson and Madonna, while heavy metal and hip hop dominated the late 1980s.

Even\n    if you are a relatively advanced researcher or analyst, this course provides\n    a foundation and a context that helps to put one\u2019s work into perspective.</p>\n<p>Statistics One also provides an introduction to the R programming language.\n    All the examples and assignments will involve writing code in R and interpreting\n    R output. R software is free! What this means is you can download R, take\n    this course, and start programming in R after just a few lectures. That\n    said, this course is not a comprehensive guide to R or to programming in\n    general.&nbsp;</p>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/stats1/large-icon.png", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/stats1/small-icon.hover.png", "large_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/stats1/large-icon.png", "video": "O3gVAVFIjYo", "university-ids": ["princeton"], "id": 25, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": "", "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "princeton", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d4/29daf4b768e1aa467202d4d2dcf8d8/favicon-princeton.ico", "website_facebook": "PrincetonU", "id": 4, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/94/cc9200e336d38ce029873b13cbe93b/logo-princeton-front.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "", "location_country": "", "location_lat": null, "location": "", "primary_color": "#BA632D", "abbr_name": "Princeton", "website": "http://www.princeton.edu/", "description": "Princeton University is a private research university located in Princeton, New Jersey, United States.

This course will\naddress these issues and will provide information on effective strategies\nfor adopting and maintaining these targeted behaviors that can be applied\nto the adoption and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle.\n<br>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/09/415f182d21feec726a483188f6b929/NewNutrition-LARGE.gif", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/be/85a530cd01a05ba40e5a0991b3ff3a/NewNutrition-LARGE.gif", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/bb/8bbed1dc0544194f60e3cc38bec918/NewNutrition-LARGE.gif", "video": "zpBRXJhU_3k", "university-ids": ["pitt"], "id": 162, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "PittTweet", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/00/ee7a228aa46a231152d55b9bb9d0ae/logo_16x16.png", "website_facebook": "UPitt", "id": 36, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/79/17cec4653cf480709f1e1387174c10/course_logo_160x60.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "", "location_country": "", "location_lat": null, "location": "", "primary_color": "#211c51", "abbr_name": "Pittsburgh", "website": "http://www.pitt.edu/", "description": "Leader in Education | Pioneer in Research | Partner in Regional Development", "short_name": "pitt", "location_state": "", "website_youtube": "pittweb", "banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/b4/a20a6bc0497aff000b698a477aebba/banner_928x220.jpg", "landing_page_banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/9f0fef78e7139d3b7b13241df58529/banner-edit.jpg", "name": "University of Pittsburgh", "square_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ec/05df639c8e1a3ff7617e1997f0feae/pittseal360x360-edit.png", "square_logo_source": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/e7/eaadeaf0338f3f65156f819507e423/pittseal360x360-edit.png", "display": true, "location_lng": null, "home_link": null, "class_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7b/10384469bc3891766ffd0ab7eb40b4/wide-logo.png", "square_logo_svg": ""}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "", "course_syllabus": "There are no required textbooks for this course.

School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box \u2013 a valuable ability in today\u2019s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The primary audience is first-year students at college or university who are thinking of majoring in mathematics or a mathematically-dependent subject, or high school seniors who have such a college career in mind.

{"about_the_course": "The MOS transistor (MOSFET) is the workhorse of the microelectronic revolution.

Part of the MOS transistor's success lies in its very small size (you can fit 1,000 of them within the <i>width</i> of a human hair!), part lies on some amazing things this device&nbsp;can do. However, the descriptions of MOS transistors in basic electronics courses cannot begin to do&nbsp;justice to this device.&nbsp;If you want to really know how the MOSFET&nbsp;operates, and how to model it, you need to study it carefully and systematically. This course will help you do just that.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>The course starts with a review of basic physical principles, and expands into a detailed treatment of MOS transistor phenomena, in a logical and systematic fashion, enhanced by intuitive discussions. We discuss a hierarchy of models - from the simple to the sophisticated - clearly identifying the connections between them, and encompassing many aspects of modeling, including dc, large-signal transient operation, quasi-static operation, non-quasi-static operation, small-signal operation,&nbsp;noise, and structural effects.

Dr. Hwu received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of&nbsp;California, Berkeley.</div>\n<div><br>\n<div>In 2007, Hwu teamed up with then NVIDIA Chief Scientist David Kirk to create a course&nbsp;called Programming Massively Parallel Processors (<a href=\"https://ece408.hwu.crhc.illinois.edu\" target=\"_blank\">https://ece408.hwu.crhc.illinois.edu</a>).&nbsp;Thousands of students worldwide follow the course through the web site each semester.&nbsp;The course material has also been used by numerous universities including MIT, Stanford,&nbsp;and Georgia Tech. Hwu and Kirk have also been teaching a VSCSE Summer School&nbsp;version to science and engineering graduate students from all over the world. In 2008,&nbsp;50 graduates from 17 countries and three continents attended the summer school (<a href=\"http://www.greatlakesconsortium.org/events/GPUMulticore/\">http://www.greatlakesconsortium.org/events/GPUMulticore/</a>) in Urbana with another 60 participating&nbsp;remotely. Students in the summer school come from diverse disciplines. In 2009, the summer&nbsp;school was again fully subscribed with 160 students from multiple continents. The 2010 offering&nbsp;was attended by 220 students at four sites linked with HD video. The 2011 attendance further&nbsp;increased to 280 at 10 sites across the U.S. The 2012 summer school is projected to have more&nbsp;than 320 students at 10 linked sites. Due to popular demand, Hwu and Kirk have also been&nbsp;teaching abbreviated versions of their course globally, most recently at the Chinese Academy&nbsp;of Science in 2008, Berkeley in 2010, Braga Portugal in 2010, and Chile in 2011. They have&nbsp;also collaborated with UPC/Barcelona Supercomputing Center to offer an EU PUMPS summer&nbsp;school in Barcelona every year since 2010. In February 2010, Hwu and Kirk published a&nbsp;textbook on programming massively parallel processors. The book has been extremely popular,&nbsp;with more than 10,000 copies sold to date.

{"about_the_course": "Computer technology has transformed how we participate in democracy. The way we cast our votes, the way our votes are counted, and the way we choose who will lead are increasingly controlled by invisible computer software. Most U.S. states have adopted electronic voting, and countries around the world are starting to collect votes over the Internet. However, computerized voting raises startling security risks that are only beginning to be understood outside the research lab, from voting machine viruses that can silently change votes to the possibility that hackers in foreign countries could steal an election. This course will provide the technical background and public policy foundation that 21st century citizens need to understand the electronic voting debate. You'll learn how electronic voting and Internet voting technologies work, why they're being introduced, and what problems they aim to solve. You'll also learn about the computer- and Internet-security risks these systems face and the serious vulnerabilities that recent research has demonstrated. We'll cover widely used safeguards, checks, and balances &mdash; and why they are often inadequate. Finally, we'll see how computer technology has the potential to improve election security, if it's applied intelligently. Along the way, you'll hear stories from the lab and from the trenches on a journey that leads from Mumbai jail cells to the halls of Washington, D.C. You'll come away from this course understanding why you can be confident your own vote will count &mdash; or why you should reasonably be skeptical.", "other_description": null, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/digitaldemocracy/large-icon.png", "preview_link": "", "small_icon_hover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/digitaldemocracy/small-icon.hover.png", "large_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/digitaldemocracy/large-icon.png", "video": "eXSF798qnCA", "university-ids": ["umich"], "id": 39, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "umich", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/50/52265d555e7bf0b0b86f7a1a07a183/favicon-umich.ico", "website_facebook": "universityofmichigan", "id": 3, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/99/263203c94842c44bcf757c4a801e8f/U-M_LogoSmHoriz_160x60.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Ann Arbor", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 42.2808256, "location": "Ann Arbor, MI", "primary_color": "#002e5f", "abbr_name": "Michigan", "website": "http://www.umich.edu/", "description": "The University of Michigan is a public research university located in Ann Arbor, Michigan in the United States.", "short_name": "umich", "location_state": "MI", "website_youtube": "user/um", "banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/36/1d953d8380a15d8eb0d307c7cde0bb/banner-umich.jpg", "landing_page_banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/03/70c6a457583d267a869cb6555b4de5/DIL-17Apr12_AT150a_EDIT_TO_2.jpg", "name": "University of Michigan", "square_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/70/de505d47be7d3a063b51b6f856a6e2/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_600x600.png", "square_logo_source": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/26/23ecbedd1043250eab7d1b0a41696b/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_600x600.png", "display": true, "location_lng": -83.74303780000002, "home_link": null, "class_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/05/1a1f4b975bf71dba0ac79042ed651e/U-M_LogoSmHoriz_200x48.png", "square_logo_svg": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/6b/fce84d27ebcd493f839f14df253541/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_.svg"}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": null, "course_syllabus": "", "description": "", "short_name": "digitaldemocracy", "target_audience": 0, "faq": "", "category-ids": ["infotech", "cs-systems"], "visibility": 0, "short_description": "In this course, you'll learn what every citizen should know about the security risks--and future potential &mdash; of electronic voting and Internet voting.", "course_format": "<div>The class will consist of lecture videos totaling about 2 hours a week.

However, we will see that the\nEuropean mystical traditions, including Kabbalah in the Jewish world and those\nof the Catholic and Protestant worlds, developed their own elaborate systems of\npsychological thought. Thus, we will mostly examine mystical psychology on its\nown terms. We shall especially look at two terms that are very much in use also\nin general culture: the heart (as an emotional rather than as a physical center!...)\nand the soul, looking at the unique mystical concepts of their nature and destiny\nand asking if there were influences and meetings between the different\nreligions.&nbsp;</p><p></p>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f0/ca11f155e125282c51413211796d9d/ThinkLogo.jpg", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/58/e29cfad54ad288ec6c8898f29ea694/ThinkLogo.jpg", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/19/eb4e2328e003742b4091e6161f8e1d/ThinkLogo.jpg", "video": "", "university-ids": ["huji"], "id": 196, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/48/7cac159746dca5674234142a147d0f/HebrewSmallIcon2.png", "website_facebook": "", "id": 24, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/66/b7a799a8992913a9a702a22ae8bdcb/HebrewLogo4.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "", "location_country": "", "location_lat": null, "location": "", "primary_color": "#c12127", "abbr_name": "Hebrew University", "website": "", "description": "", "short_name": "huji", "location_state": "", "website_youtube": "", "banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/03/fadb443f52e728749d13bb0fdcbb32/HebrewBanner.jpg", "landing_page_banner": null, "name": "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "square_logo": null, "square_logo_source": null, "display": true, "location_lng": null, "home_link": null, "class_logo": null, "square_logo_svg": null}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": null, "course_syllabus": "", "description": "", "short_name": "mysticthought", "target_audience": 0, "faq": "<div><p><b>What is the coolest thing that I will learn in this\ncourse?</b></p>\n\n<p>That actually twentieth\ncentury psychoanalysis itself may be indebted to religious and mystical ideas. </p>\n\n<p><b>Do you recommend that I read anything order to prepare\nfor the course?</b></p>\n\n<p>It is a good idea to do\nsome wiki-based research on Mysticism, Kabbalah, and Psychoanalysis, especially\nthe thought of Carl Jung and James Hillman. </p>\n\n<p><b>Do I need to purchase any textbooks?</b></p>\n\n<p>No, all course materials\nwill be available through the website.&nbsp;</p></div>", "category-ids": ["humanities"], "visibility": 0, "short_description": "The course will examine the psychological thought of the modern mystical traditions in Europe.

The course will then explore the history of health care reform and the challenges that were overcome to achieve health reform in America. Finally, we will delineate the specific ways that the Affordable Care Act improves access and quality, and will control costs.

Additional optional readings are provided\nfor those who wish to delve deeper into a particular topic.</li><li><b><i>Why do you have optional\nreadings?</i></b><br>Some people may be interesting in\nlearning more about a topic.&nbsp; For those students, we have identified\noptional readings.&nbsp; These optional readings provide background material or\nmore in-depth information on a topic.&nbsp; You will&nbsp;be graded only on\ninformation in the required readings. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><b><u>Assignments</u></b>:</p><ul><li><b><i>I can\u2019t complete an assignment.&nbsp;\nWill I fail?</i></b><br>The top 6 of 8 assignments are calculated for your\ngrade.&nbsp; Thus you may miss 2 assignments\nwithout impacting your grade.<b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></li><li><b><i>How will I be graded?</i></b><br>You are given one assignment each week.&nbsp; The top 6 of 8 assignments are calculated for\nyour grade.&nbsp; Thus you may miss 2\nassignments without impacting your grade.&nbsp;\nFor each assignment, you will be graded by a minimum of four other\npeople.&nbsp; The high and low score for each\nassignment will be tossed out and the other scores averaged.</li><li><b><i>Am I required to participate in the forums?&nbsp; Are the quizzes graded?</i></b><br>Participation in the forums and quizzes available through\nthe video content are not graded.</li><li><b><i>How will I grade others?</i></b><br>Reviewers will receive a grading rubric and sample answer.</li><li><b><i>How will you ensure that the grades are fair?</i></b><br>We expect students are motivated to participate in their\neducation and we ask that everyone grade each other in an objective, fair, and\nunbiased manner.&nbsp; Grading will be\ndouble-blind; graders will not know whose work they are grading, and students\nwill not know who graded their work.&nbsp;\nEach assignment is graded by several different people, which will reduce\nany potential bias, with the high and low scores dropped for each student.&nbsp; Furthermore, the selection of assignments to\ngrade for each person will be random each week, so any given student is\nunlikely to have his/her work graded by any given student grader more than once.&nbsp; Finally, we will be checking the grading for\nconsistency (e.g. by comparing against grades assigned by the instructor to a\nfew \"sample\" assignments).</li><li><b><i>Why do you require students to grade each other?</i></b><br>This course is freely available on the internet.&nbsp; During the summer 2012 course, 31, 967\nstudents signed up for the course.&nbsp;\nCoursera and the University of Pennsylvania are not able to support\nproviding this course free for everyone without utilizing innovative and\nnon-traditional grading mechanisms.&nbsp; We\nalso believe that in grading each other, you will learn the material\nbetter.</li><li><b><i>What happens if I grade more assignments one week than the minimum\nrequired?&nbsp; Will I get extra credit?</i></b><br>You will receive the appreciation of your classmates and\nhopefully a greater understanding of the material.&nbsp; You will not, however, receive any extra\ncredit.</li><li><b><i>Can I grade extra assignments one week to make up for grading fewer\nassignments another week?</i></b><br>No.&nbsp; You are required to grade a minimum\nof five assignments each week.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><b><u>Technical</u></b></p>\n\n<ul><li><b><i>Please\nprovide a spell-check option.</i></b><br>Until Coursera is able to provide this option, we suggest that you draft\nyour answer in Word, spell-check it, and then copy and paste your answer into\nthe answer box.</li><li><b><i>How\ndo I copy my answer into the assignment submission box?&nbsp; It does not work.</i></b><br>This is possibly a browser issue; Coursera is optimized for Google\nChrome.&nbsp; Try using the command keys to\ncopy and paste your answer from Word: Ctrl-A (highlight all), Ctrl-C (copy),\nand Ctrl-V (paste).</li><li><b><i>How\ndo you close the window for the multiple-choice question to resume the lecture\nvideo after the quizzes pop up?</i></b><br>This is possibly a browser issue.&nbsp; Coursera supports modern web standards and\nthe many devices that run browsers that support these features.&nbsp; Chrome, Firefox, IE (9-10), and Safari meet\nthese requirements.&nbsp; <br></li></ul>\n\n\n<br>", "category-ids": ["economics", "health"], "visibility": 0, "short_description": "This course will explore the many problems of the American health care system and discuss the specific ways that the Affordable Care Act will impact access, quality, costs, as well as medical innovation.", "course_format": "<p>This class is eight weeks long.

{"about_the_course": "<p>English Composition I provides an introduction to and foundation\nfor the academic reading and writing characteristic of college. Attending\nexplicitly to disciplinary context, you will learn to read critically, write\neffective arguments, understand the writing process, and craft powerful prose\nthat meets readers\u2019 expectations. You will gain writing expertise by exploring questions about expertise itself: What factors impact expert achievement? What does it take to succeed? Who determines success? Since personal investment yields better writing, you can select an area of expertise meaningful to you (a hobby, trade, profession, discipline, etc.) for your major writing projects, which will be drafted and revised in sequenced stages: a critical response to an argument about expertise (2pp.); an explication of a visual image (2pp.); a case study of an expert (4pp.) and an Op-Ed (2 pp.). Your writing will be central to the course as we create a seminar/workshop structure with peer response and selected instructor feedback.&nbsp;</p><p>Two overarching assumptions about academic writing will shape our work:&nbsp; 1) it is transferable; 2) it is learnable. Being an\neffective academic writer involves asking meaningful questions and\nengaging in complex dialogue with texts and ideas. These skills are useful across\nvirtually all academic disciplines and they provide a valuable means for making sense of non-academic experiences as well.\nPerhaps even more important, though, is that learning how to write effectively does not require inspiration\nor genius, but hard work, reflection, and feedback. This means that, with\npractice, dedication, and working with others,<i> you</i> can be an effective academic\nwriter and contribute your ideas to important, ongoing conversations.

Who were they?\nWhere did they come from? Why is there today only one species of humans\u2014<i>Homo\nsapiens</i>\u2014and what happened to all the others?<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 2: The Tree of Knowledge\n</b></p>\n\n<p>The Cognitive Revolution, about\n70,000 years ago, enabled <i>Homo sapiens</i> to conquer the world and drive\nall other human species to extinction. <i>Homo sapiens</i> developed new\ncognitive abilities, which manifested in the appearance of \u201cmodern language.\u201d\nHow was this language different from the languages of earlier human species and\nof other animals? Why can we consider the appearance of this new type of\nlanguage as the beginning of history? How is history different from biology?<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 3: A Day in the Life of\nAdam and Eve</b></p>\n\n<p>What was life like for the people\nwho lived between the Cognitive Revolution (c. 70,000 years ago) and the\nAgricultural Revolution (c. 10,000 years ago)? What did they do when they woke\nup in the morning? What were their societies like? Did they have monogamous\nrelationships and nuclear families? Did they have religions, revolutions, and\nwars?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 4: The Flood</b></p>\n\n<p>Following the Cognitive Revolution,\n<i>Homo sapiens</i> spread all over the planet. While doing this, it drove\nnumerous other species into extinction. In Australia, up to 95% of all large\nanimal species vanished. In America,\n84 of 107 large mammal species likewise disappeared. Altogether, about half of\nthe large terrestrial mammal species that populated Earth became extinct. How\ncould a few million individuals who possessed no more than stone-age technology\nhave wrought such devastation?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Part II: The Agricultural Revolution</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 5: History\u2019s Biggest\nFraud</b></p>\n\n<p>About 10,000 years ago, people in\nthe Middle East, China, and Central America began domesticating plants and animals.\nIn the process, <i>Homo sapiens</i>,<i>\n</i>too, was domesticated, abandoning a life of hunting and gathering\nfor the pleasures and discomforts of permanent settlements. For most people,\nthe discomforts outweighed the pleasures. The Agricultural Revolution made the\nlife of the average person harder and grimmer. Why, then, did it occur?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 6: Building Pyramids</b></p>\n\n<p>For millions of years, humans lived\nin intimate bands of no more than a few dozen individuals. Our biological\ninstincts evolved as an adaptation to this way of life. Humans were therefore\nill-equipped to cooperate with large numbers of strangers. This hasn\u2019t changed\nmuch. Yet within a few millennia after the onset of the Agricultural\nRevolution, humans established cities, kingdoms, and empires. How did people\nmanage to organize stable societies based on intensive cooperation between\nmillions of strangers when our biological makeup seems to preclude such\narrangements?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 7: A Revolution in\nData-Processing </b></p>\n\n<p>One of the critical factors that\nenabled millions of strangers to cooperate successfully was the invention of\nwriting. How was writing invented, and what was its historical significance?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 8: There is No Justice\nin History </b></p>\n\n<p>Another critical factor in the\nformation of complex societies was the division of the population into a\nhierarchy of groups. Agricultural and industrial societies have been built on\nhierarchies of class, race, ethnicity, or gender. Why was it impossible to\ncreate a just and equal society? What is the deep root of prejudice and\ninjustice? In particular, why have almost all known societies over the past\n10,000 years believed that men are superior to women?<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Part III: The Unification of Humankind</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 9: The Arrow of History\n</b></p>\n\n<p>In the millennia following the\nAgricultural Revolution, humans created many different cultures. How did these\ncultures relate to one another? Are there universal patterns governing the\ninteraction between them?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 10: The Scent of Money</b></p>\n\n<p>Commerce has played a crucial role\nin connecting and merging cultures. Of particular importance was the\ninvention\u2014and spread\u2014of money. Money is a system of mutual trust. It is in fact\nthe most universal, most open-minded, and most successful system of mutual\ntrust ever devised. How did it happen that people who believe in different gods\nand obey different rulers nevertheless trust the same money?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 11: Imperial Visions</b></p>\n\n<p>The idea of empire is seen today in\na very negative light, but empires have played such a central role in human\nhistory that it\u2019s hard to regard them as solidly evil. What exactly is an\nempire? How have empires succeeded in uniting under their aegis different\necological regions, ethnic groups, and religious communities? How can we\nbalance the positive contribution of empires with their record of violence and\noppression? And what is the future of the imperial ideal? Is the world destined\nto be ruled by a new global empire?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 12: The Law of Religion</b></p>\n\n<p>The role of religion in history is\nextremely controversial. Some see religion as the root of all evil, while for\nothers it is the primary source of happiness, empathy, and progress. Can we\narrive at a balanced judgment? What were the main landmarks in the religious\nhistory of the world? In what ways did different cultures understand the\nuniverse, distinguish good from evil, and grapple with the ubiquitous presence\nof suffering?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 13: The Secret of\nSuccess</b></p>\n\n<p>Why did some religions spread like\nwildfire while others disappeared? Why did some empires last for centuries, yet\nothers were as ephemeral as sand castles? Can we identify the secret of historical\nsuccess, and will it help us to predict the future course of history?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Part IV. The Scientific Revolution</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 14: The Discovery of\nIgnorance</b></p>\n\n<p>During the last 500 years there has\nbeen an explosive and exponential growth in the power of humankind, due, above\nall, to the formation of the modern scientific tradition and its ideal of\n\u201cprogress.\u201d Humankind has become increasingly convinced that the only thing\nthat limits its power is its own ignorance, and that the discovery of new\nknowledge can enable it to do almost anything. How is the modern scientific\ntradition different from all previous traditions of knowledge? What accounts\nfor its sudden rise and for its unparalleled achievements?<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 15: The Marriage of\nScience and Empire</b></p>\n\n<p>The modern scientific tradition\ndeveloped in symbiosis with the modern imperial tradition. For many of their\npractitioners, science and imperialism were almost indistinguishable. The\nconquest of new knowledge depended upon and made possible the conquest of new\nterritories. Why did all of this begin in Europe\nof all places, an area that previously had played no important role in world\nhistory? How did science help build empires, and how did empire-builders repay\nthe scientists?<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 16: The Capitalist Creed</b></p>\n\n<p>The close relationship of science\nand imperialism was in fact just one part of a m\u00e9nage-\u00e0-trois. The third\ncrucial member of this trio was modern capitalism, which financed both science\nand empire, and which orchestrated an unprecedented growth in the world\neconomy. How does a capitalist economy function? How is it different from\ntraditional economies? Is capitalism natural, or is it really a modern\nreligion?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 17: The Wheels of\nIndustry</b></p>\n\n<p>During the last 200 years, the\ncombination of science, imperialism and capitalism gave humankind control of\nenormous new energy resources that revolutionized human production. How did this\nchange the global ecology, daily life, and human psychology?<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 18: A Permanent\nRevolution</b></p>\n\n<p>The industrial revolution unhinged\nthe world, opening an era of permanent revolution. The late modern\nsocio-political order is in constant flux, never settling into any stable\npattern. The pillars of human order\u2014most notably, the family and the intimate\ncommunity\u2014are crumbling around us. How do humans deal with the resulting vacuum\nand chaos? How do society and politics function without stability? Is the world\nbecoming more violent and dangerous, or is it actually more peaceful and secure\nthan ever before?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 19: And They Lived\nHappily Ever After </b></p>\n\n<p>Have 500 years of unimaginable\ndiscoveries, developments, and revolutions made people happier? If not, what\nwas the point of all these changes? Most history books ignore these issues, yet\nthese are the most important questions we can ask about history. New insights\nfrom biology, economics, and psychology are offering fascinating paths of\ninquiry into the history of human happiness.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 20: The End of <i>Homo Sapiens</i>\n</b></p>\n\n<p>Over the last few decades humans\nhave began to bend and break the laws of natural selection\u2014laws that have\ngoverned life on Earth for the past four billion years. Genetic engineering,\ncyborg engineering, and the engineering of completely non-organic life promise\nto dislodge natural selection\u2014in favor of intelligent design\u2014as the supreme\nprinciple of life. We are acquiring unprecedented abilities to design not only\nthe world around us, but also our own bodies, our personalities, and our\ndesires. How will this influence society and culture?

Moreno, Ph.D.<br><br>\u201cPerhaps a man really dies when his brain stops, when he loses the power to take in a new idea.\u201d --George Orwell<br><br> Neuroethics might well be the most rapidly growing area within bioethics; indeed, in some respects neuroethics has grown as an independent field, with its own journals, professional society and institutional centers. This growth over the past decade is partly attributable to the growth of neuroscience itself and to the challenging philosophical and moral questions it inherently raises. A 2012 Royal Society report observes that \u201c(a)n increasingly mechanistic understanding of the brain raises a host of ethical, legal, and social implications. This has laid the foundation for the emergent field of Neuroethics, which examines ethical issues governing the conceptual and practical developments of neuroscience. Irrespective of their validity, even the claims that modern neuroscience entails the re-examination of complex and sensitive topics like free will, consciousness, identity, and responsibility raises significant ethical issues. As such, neuroethics asks questions that extend beyond the usual umbrella of biomedical ethics.\u201d This course will, therefore, consider the new knowledge and ways of learning about the brain from scientific and ethico-legal and social standpoints. We will examine the core themes of neuroethics, including cognitive enhancement, the nature of the self and personhood, neuroimaging and privacy, and the ways that all these themes are brought together in matters affecting national security.<br><br> <strong><br></strong>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/neuroethics/large-icon.png", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/neuroethics/small-icon.hover.png", "large_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/neuroethics/large-icon.png", "video": "-p3iFE06q14", "university-ids": ["penn"], "id": 50, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": "", "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "@pennopencourses", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f3/2ca37fd0d5d009a94e0ba7f284c860/favicon-penn.ico", "website_facebook": "", "id": 6, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7c/5d03cbe2cb87974be7f83cc1080af8/logo-penn-front.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "", "location_country": "", "location_lat": null, "location": "City, State, Country", "primary_color": "#0000ff", "abbr_name": "Penn", "website": "http://provost.upenn.edu/initiatives/openlearning", "description": "The University of Pennsylvania (commonly referred to as Penn or UPenn) is a private university, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.

{"about_the_course": "Fantasy is a key term both in psychology and in the art and artifice of humanity. The things we make, including our stories, reflect, serve, and often shape our needs and desires. We see this everywhere from fairy tale to kiddie lit to myth; from \"Cinderella\" to <i>Alice in Wonderland </i>to <i>Superman</i>; from building a fort as a child to building ideal, planned cities as whole societies. Fantasy in ways both entertaining and practical serves our persistent needs and desires and illuminates the human mind. Fantasy expresses itself in many ways, from the comfort we feel in the godlike powers of a fairy godmother to the seductive unease we feel confronting Dracula. From a practical viewpoint, of all the fictional forms that fantasy takes, science fiction, from <i>Frankenstein</i> to <i>Avatar</i>, is the most important in our modern world because it is the only kind that explicitly recognizes the profound ways in which science and technology, those key products of the human mind, shape not only our world but our very hopes and fears. This course will explore Fantasy in general and Science Fiction in specific both as art and as insights into ourselves and our world. <br><br>\n<h2>Work Expectations</h2>\nFor further information about the coursework, please see the <a href=\"http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/fantasysf/Documents/WorkExpectations.html\"> Work Expectations</a> page.", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/fantasysf/large-icon.png", "preview_link": "", "small_icon_hover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/fantasysf/small-icon.hover.png", "large_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/fantasysf/large-icon.png", "video": "wgNrVnjvjKo", "university-ids": ["umich"], "id": 41, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "umich", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/50/52265d555e7bf0b0b86f7a1a07a183/favicon-umich.ico", "website_facebook": "universityofmichigan", "id": 3, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/99/263203c94842c44bcf757c4a801e8f/U-M_LogoSmHoriz_160x60.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Ann Arbor", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 42.2808256, "location": "Ann Arbor, MI", "primary_color": "#002e5f", "abbr_name": "Michigan", "website": "http://www.umich.edu/", "description": "The University of Michigan is a public research university located in Ann Arbor, Michigan in the United States.", "short_name": "umich", "location_state": "MI", "website_youtube": "user/um", "banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/36/1d953d8380a15d8eb0d307c7cde0bb/banner-umich.jpg", "landing_page_banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/03/70c6a457583d267a869cb6555b4de5/DIL-17Apr12_AT150a_EDIT_TO_2.jpg", "name": "University of Michigan", "square_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/70/de505d47be7d3a063b51b6f856a6e2/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_600x600.png", "square_logo_source": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/26/23ecbedd1043250eab7d1b0a41696b/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_600x600.png", "display": true, "location_lng": -83.74303780000002, "home_link": null, "class_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/05/1a1f4b975bf71dba0ac79042ed651e/U-M_LogoSmHoriz_200x48.png", "square_logo_svg": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/6b/fce84d27ebcd493f839f14df253541/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_.svg"}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "", "course_syllabus": "This course comprises ten units.

However, for some works I believe some editions are better than others. For example, some editions of <i>The Island of Dr. Moreau</i> omit Charles Edward Prendick's \"Introduction\"; however, since that \"Introduction\" was actually written by H. G. Wells and included in the original publication of the book, it should not be omitted. For some works, I believe that a printed text is preferable. For example, the paper versions of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> printed with <i>Through the Looking-Glass</i> along with James Tenniel's illustrations for both give one a sense of Lewis Carroll's original intent and design. The University of Adelaide's eBooks@Adelaide site makes available both <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> and <i>Through the Looking-Glass</i>with Tenniel's illustrations placed approximately where they were in the original text, although the chapters themselves are not broken into pages. Thus that online edition, for many people, is a reasonable although not exact substitute for the printed book.

Different people work best different ways. I like to read slowly, underline, write in the margins, and make up an index to a work when I've finished reading it. For me reading in advance often works nicely because I can, just before the moment when I need to discuss the work, review the underlinings and the index to fully refresh my memory and get an overview of the work. For other people, particularly those who don't take extensive notes, reading quite close to the moment of discussion or of writing about the work is crucial.

Topics include\n            depth-first search, breadth-first search, topological sort, Kosaraju-Sharir,\n            Kruskal, Prim, Dijkistra, Bellman-Ford, Ford-Fulkerson, LSD radix sort,\n            MSD radix sort, 3-way radix quicksort, multiway tries, ternary search tries,\n            Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Boyer-Moore, Rabin-Karp, &gt;regular expression matching,\n            run-length coding, Huffman coding, LZW compression, and the Burrows-Wheeler\n            transform.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Are there any associated resources available on the web?</strong>\n\n        <p>Yes. Our free<a href=\"http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu\" target=\"_blank\"> booksite</a> contains\n            synopses of the text, web exercises, Java implementations of all the algorithms\n            covered (any many more) that are designed for you to be able to download\n            and use with one click, test data, and many other resources.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>How does this course differ from Design and Analysis of Algorithms?</strong>\n\n        <p>The two courses are complementary. This one is essentially a programming\n            course that concentrates on developing code; that one is essentially a\n            math course that concentrates on understanding proofs. This course is about\n            learning algorithms in the context of implementing and testing them in\n            practical applications; that one is about learning algorithms in the context\n            of developing mathematical models that help explain why they are efficient.\n            In typical computer science curriculums, a course like this one is taken\n            by first- and second-year students and a course like that one is taken\n            by juniors and seniors.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>I am/was not a computer science major. Is this course for me?</strong>\n\n        <p>Yes. This course is for anyone using a computer to address large problems\n            (and therefore needing efficient algorithms). At Princeton, over 25% of\n            all students take the course, including people majoring in engineering,\n            biology, physics, chemistry, economics, and many other fields, not just\n            computer science.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>If I have no familiarity with Java programming, can I still take the course?\n        </strong>\n        <p>Our central thesis is that algorithms are best understood by implementing\n            and testing them. Our use of Java is essentially expository, and we shy\n            away from exotic features, so we expect you would be able to adapt our\n            code to your favorite language. However, we require that you submit the\n            programming assignments in Java. If you have some experience programming\n            in another language, you might find it worthwhile to learn our programming\n            model by studying our book An Introduction to Programming in Java: An Interdisciplinary\n            Approach and associated free <a href=\"http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu\" target=\"_blank\">booksite</a>.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>If I have not programmed before, can I still take the course?\n        </strong>\n        <p>Probably not.</p>\n        <p></p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Does Princeton University award credentials or reports regarding my work in this course?</strong>\n     \n        <p>No certificates, statements of accomplishment, or other credentials will\n            be awarded in connection with this course.</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>", "category-ids": ["cs-theory", "cs-programming"], "visibility": 0, "short_description": "This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations.

{"about_the_course": "<p>This\ncourse will introduce the student to contemporary Systems Biology focused on\nmammalian cells, their constituents and their functions.&nbsp; Biology is moving from molecular to modular.\nAs our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists\nof molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we need\nto understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that\nact as discrete functional systems.&nbsp;\nThese systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal\ntransduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn\nthese processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion,\nproliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular\nand cellular systems?&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the\nmechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise?&nbsp; What types of experiments inform systems-level\nthinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these\nsystems?</p>\n\n<p>The course will develop multiple lines of\nreasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads\nare: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that\nproduce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations.&nbsp; Examples will be discussed to demonstrate\n\u201chow\u201d cell- level functions arise and \u201cwhy\u201d mechanistic knowledge allows us to\npredict cellular behaviors leading to disease states and drug responses.<br></p>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f2/189f2000aa98ae02d2d07b2a7afef9/Introduction_SB_logo_460X270_v2.png", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/73/6cd405d11bc3ff4878da9481bfc4f1/Introduction_SB_logo_460X270_v2.png", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b9/e9ad4b94d9f77264646f5a07436f5d/Introduction_SB_logo_460X270_v2.png", "video": "", "university-ids": ["mssm"], "id": 178, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "mountsinainyc", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/6e/050cc941c1081a711d979b25b7b108/Course_catalog_page_16x16.png", "website_facebook": "MountSinaiMedicine", "id": 27, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/40/20e4ab932508164766302a9bf01c5c/mount_sinai.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "New York", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 40.7143528, "location": "New York, NY", "primary_color": "#0f487c", "abbr_name": "Mount Sinai", "website": "http://www.mssm.edu/", "description": "The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, formerly the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, is an American medical school in the borough of Manhattan in New York City.

{"about_the_course": "Popularized by movies such as \"A Beautiful Mind\", game theory is the mathematical modeling of strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents.

How could you begin to model eBay, Google keyword auctions, and peer to peer file-sharing networks, without accounting for the incentives of the people using them? The course will provide the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions), repeated and stochastic games, and more.

{"about_the_course": "<p>Our course demonstrates how a new scholarship of discovery is redefining\n    what is singular about modern China and modern Chinese history. The current\n    understanding of human history and social theory is based largely on Western\n    experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This\n    course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience\n    during the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of the\n    new scholarship of discovery divided into three independent parts, which\n    means that students can take any part without prior or subsequent attendance\n    of the other parts.Part 1 addresses the issue of \u201cWho Gets What\u201d and covers\n    sequentially inequality and education, education and social mobility, social\n    mobility and wealth distribution, wealth distribution and regime change,\n    and regime change and inequality. Part 2 turns to the related issue of\n    \u201cWho Survives\u201d and includes studies of inequality and population behavior,\n    population behavior and human development, human development and social\n    organization, and social organization and social stratification. Part 3\n    deals with issues of identification and motivation and presents studies\n    of religion and gender, ethnicity, and nationalism from late imperial times\n    to the present-day.</p>\n<p>Our class, in other words, eschews the standard chronological narrative\n    arc for an analytic approach that focuses on specific discoveries and on\n    how these new facts complicate our understanding of comparative societies,\n    human behavior, and the construction of individual and group identities.\n    That being said, while we do not emphasize the temporal narratives of late\n    imperial, early modern and contemporary China, we of course also discuss\n    change over time as China progresses from a largely domestic imperial history\n    to the shared stories of imperialism and semi colonialism, communism and\n    collectivization, and reform and globalization.</p>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c7/d55e65568fb6a79175348f0d11ea4c/James-Course-Banner.jpg", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ea/835cfd8a78494dee77c26da6dccdc8/James-Course-Banner.jpg", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ec/ea4ffe0283325bef7f65e9d22612ec/James-Course-Banner.jpg", "video": "", "university-ids": ["hkust"], "id": 217, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cb/c8497eeb219091d34206d663f73f27/ust_logo_16x16.png", "website_facebook": "", "id": 35, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/5b/4ba3ffda597d5f7d4630beefc58672/ust_logo_160x60.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "", "location_country": "", "location_lat": null, "location": "", "primary_color": "#003366", "abbr_name": "HKUST", "website": "", "description": "", "short_name": "hkust", "location_state": "", "website_youtube": "", "banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/19/697e3320bf893ca515c77a1520cb58/HKUST-Banner.jpg", "landing_page_banner": null, "name": "The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "square_logo": null, "square_logo_source": null, "display": true, "location_lng": null, "home_link": null, "class_logo": null, "square_logo_svg": null}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": null, "course_syllabus": "<p>Part 1 will cover the following subjects:</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>Social Structure and Education in Late Imperial China</li>\n    <li>Education and Social Mobility in Contemporary China</li>\n    <li>Social Mobility and Wealth Distribution in China</li>\n    <li>Wealth Distribution and Regime Change</li>\n    <li>Regime Change and Inequality</li>\n</ol>", "description": "", "short_name": "newchinahistory1", "target_audience": 0, "faq": "", "category-ids": ["socsci"], "visibility": 0, "short_description": "The purpose of this course is to summarize some of the new directions in Chinese history and Chinese social science produced by the discovery and analysis of new historical data, in particular archival documents and datasets, and to organize this knowledge in a framework that encourages learning about China in comparative perspective.", "course_format": "For each subject, we present a 45-50 minute lecture, that incorporates\nrecent research on these issues \u2013 in some cases ongoing research \u2013 and\nsuggest 50 to 100 pages of relevant reading followed by peer mentored online\ndiscussions of the lecture and assigned reading based on student discussion\nquestions.", "has_full_data": true, "social_link": null, "suggested_readings": "", "instructor": "James Z.

{"about_the_course": "<p>Natural language processing (NLP) deals with the application of computational models to text or speech data. Application areas within NLP include automatic (machine) translation between languages; dialogue systems, which allow a human to interact with a machine using natural language; and information extraction, where the goal is to transform unstructured text into structured (database) representations that can be searched and browsed in flexible ways. NLP technologies are having a dramatic impact on the way people interact with computers, on the way people interact with each other through the use of language, and on the way people access the vast amount of linguistic data now in electronic form. From a scientific viewpoint, NLP involves fundamental questions of how to structure formal models (for example statistical models) of natural language phenomena, and of how to design algorithms that implement these models.</p>\n\n<p>In this course you will study mathematical and computational models of language, and the application of these models to key problems in natural language processing. The course has a focus on machine learning methods, which are widely used in modern NLP systems: we will cover formalisms such as hidden Markov models, probabilistic context-free grammars, log-linear models, and statistical models for machine translation. The curriculum closely follows a course currently taught by Professor Collins at Columbia University, and previously taught at MIT.</p>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/26/761dfb7b58773c88fe4cb2aed26a3c/iStock_000020359734_Small.jpg", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c5/42ab154bbf6f76f51b74b8347deab5/iStock_000020359734_Small.jpg", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/7e/0150790f6c92c48d03bf6178ea9193/iStock_000020359734_Small.jpg", "video": "", "university-ids": ["columbia"], "id": 225, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": "", "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "GradSEAS", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/72/c9b56e3ff66fa6e1ca52bdea9440ae/ColumbialittleLOGO4.png", "website_facebook": "ColumbiaEngineering?fref=ts", "id": 40, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/9b/42f2eca2f10769400d1f8519892413/ColumbiaLOGO.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "New York", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 40.7143528, "location": "New York City, NY, USA", "primary_color": "#1f2f60", "abbr_name": "Columbia", "website": "", "description": "", "short_name": "columbia", "location_state": "NY", "website_youtube": "", "banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/0d/6b60ecae321cd9d6e02b5a1376e7cb/columbia-banner.jpg", "landing_page_banner": "", "name": "Columbia University", "square_logo": "", "square_logo_source": "", "display": true, "location_lng": -74.0059731, "home_link": null, "class_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/8e/592ba6a9789657a5a0912204491332/logo_cu_background_trans.png", "square_logo_svg": ""}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "", "course_syllabus": "Topics covered include:\n\n<p>\n1.

{"about_the_course": "You pick up your iPhone while waiting in line at a coffee shop. You google a not-so-famous actor, get linked to a Wikipedia entry listing his recent movies and popular YouTube clips of several of them. You check out user reviews on Amazon and pick one, download that movie on BitTorrent or stream that in Netflix. But suddenly the WiFi logo on your phone is gone and you're on 3G. Video quality starts to degrade, but you don't know if it's the server getting crowded or the Internet is congested somewhere. In any case, it costs you $10 per Gigabyte, and you decide to stop watching the movie, and instead multitask between sending tweets and calling your friend on Skype, while songs stream from iCloud to your phone. You're happy with the call quality, but get a little irritated when you see there're no new followers on Twitter. You may wonder how they all kind of work, and why sometimes they don't. Take a look at the list of 20 questions below. Each question is selected not just for its relevance to our daily lives, but also for the core concepts in the field of networking illustrated by its answers. This course is about formulating and answering these 20 questions.<br><br><strong>New feature:</strong>&nbsp;This course will launch the Grand Challenge Homework (GCH) program.

About 10 leading US companies and venture capitalists in the networking industry have agreed to screen the finalists selected by the teaching staff, and then explore opportunities with the selected students to turn their ideas and prototypes into new products and companies.

{"about_the_course": "<p>\n\n</p><p>Terrorism has\narguably been one of the defining factors of our age. It frequently\nmakes headlines, threatening or attacking governments, private business and\nordinary citizens. And in many parts of the world, it has been one of the most\nimportant threats to peace, security and stability. But what does this exactly\nmean? What is the nature of this threat? Who or what is threatened, how, by\nwhom and why? What can be done about it or how can we at least limit the impact\nof terrorism and make sure that terrorists do not make headlines and manage to\nscare us?</p><p>\n\nThese are just a handful of questions that will\nbe addressd in this course that consists of three parts. First it focuses on the\nessence of terrorism as an instrument to achieve certain goals, in addition to\nan exploration of this phenomenon and the difficulties in defining it. The\nsecond part provides an overview of the state of the art in (counter) terrorism\nstudies. Since \u20189/11\u2019 terrorism\nstudies have grown exponentially, reflecting the rise in perceived threats. But\nwhat has academia come up with? What theories, assumptions and\nconventional wisdom has it produced that could be of help in understanding\nterrorism and dealing with it? The most interesting results are examined and compared\nwith empirical evidence with the aim to either stress their importance or to\ndebunk them as myths. The final part looks into the implications and\npossibilities for policy making.</p><p>\n\n<br></p>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/29/5d4f6dfbd7b529d18d0c834ace525e/Terrorism-and-Counterterrorism.jpg", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/37/25873c28b5a43aa53d454cba0dbf75/Terrorism-and-Counterterrorism.jpg", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/69/64180fe480055ce3b330c20ffc91f8/Terrorism-and-Counterterrorism.jpg", "video": "", "university-ids": ["leiden"], "id": 451, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "UniLeiden", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ee/d18f6f5f5a5372c55cac5bc7f42b2a/ul_icon.gif", "website_facebook": "universiteitleiden", "id": 25, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1e/fb5f794f4823cbc0d36ecf9254e0e6/Wide-logo.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Leiden", "location_country": "NL", "location_lat": 52.1603216, "location": "Leiden, The Netherlands", "primary_color": "#0C2577", "abbr_name": "Leiden", "website": "http://www.leiden.edu/", "description": "Leiden University is one of Europe's foremost research universities.

{"about_the_course": "This is a course for students who are passionate about classical music\nand eager to learn more about it, but who have not necessarily had any\nadvanced technical training or taken any college-level music courses. The\nonly prerequisite is a basic knowledge of how to read musical notation.\nOtherwise, no prior experience is needed; all concepts will be explained\nin class, and musical terms will be defined as they arise. This course\nwill focus on Western classical music of the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies, music that exemplifies tonality, the system of major and minor\nkeys, including pieces composed by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann,\nChopin, Wagner, Brahms, Richard Strauss, and others. This course will tell\ntwo competing stories about tonal music and try to reconcile them. On one\nhand, we will explore what all tonal pieces have in common, the shared\nmusical language that makes them intelligible and allows them to communicate;\non the other hand, we will try to discover what makes each piece unique,\nhow composers bend the common language to say something new. Although the\ncourse will incorporate historical perspectives, it will not be a chronological\nsurvey. Instead, it will combine music theory with aesthetics, balancing\nprinciples of structural organization with insights into the aesthetic\nmeaning and effects of these principles. By illustrating his lectures with\nhis own performances at the keyboard, Professor Korsyn will bring the music\nto life.", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/de/c10e45a894f18c07b7c1506ca73aba/introtoclassical_Logo_3.jpg", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c3/41d8a7942b594d66989479c9c9bb20/introtoclassical_Logo_3.jpg", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/76/90e1775c6495b5d260e24780837e61/introtoclassical_Logo_3.jpg", "video": "Hr_PIOV8T8w", "university-ids": ["umich"], "id": 376, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "umich", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/50/52265d555e7bf0b0b86f7a1a07a183/favicon-umich.ico", "website_facebook": "universityofmichigan", "id": 3, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/99/263203c94842c44bcf757c4a801e8f/U-M_LogoSmHoriz_160x60.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Ann Arbor", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 42.2808256, "location": "Ann Arbor, MI", "primary_color": "#002e5f", "abbr_name": "Michigan", "website": "http://www.umich.edu/", "description": "The University of Michigan is a public research university located in Ann Arbor, Michigan in the United States.", "short_name": "umich", "location_state": "MI", "website_youtube": "user/um", "banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/36/1d953d8380a15d8eb0d307c7cde0bb/banner-umich.jpg", "landing_page_banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/03/70c6a457583d267a869cb6555b4de5/DIL-17Apr12_AT150a_EDIT_TO_2.jpg", "name": "University of Michigan", "square_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/70/de505d47be7d3a063b51b6f856a6e2/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_600x600.png", "square_logo_source": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/26/23ecbedd1043250eab7d1b0a41696b/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_600x600.png", "display": true, "location_lng": -83.74303780000002, "home_link": null, "class_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/05/1a1f4b975bf71dba0ac79042ed651e/U-M_LogoSmHoriz_200x48.png", "square_logo_svg": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/6b/fce84d27ebcd493f839f14df253541/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_.svg"}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "", "course_syllabus": "<a href=\"https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/introtoclassical/documents/Intro_to_Classical_Music_Syllabus.pdf\"\ntarget=\"_blank\">Download Syllabus</a>", "description": "", "short_name": "introtoclassical", "target_audience": 0, "faq": "", "category-ids": ["music"], "visibility": 0, "short_description": "This course will focus on Western classical music of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; it is designed for people who are passionate about classical music but who have not necessarily had any advanced training or taken any college-level music courses.

{"about_the_course": "<p>The\ncourse Network Analysis in Systems Biology provides an introduction to network\nanalysis and statistical methods used in contemporary Systems Biology and Systems Pharmacology research.

Methods to process raw data from genome-wide\nRNA (microarrays and RNA-seq) and proteomics (IP-MS and phosphoproteomics)\nprofiling will be presented. Processed data will be clustered, and gene-set\nenrichment analyses methods will be covered. The course will also discuss\ntopics in network systems pharmacology including processing and using databases\nof drug-target interactions, drug structure, drug/adverse-events, and drug\ninduced gene expression signatures.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n\n<span>We take a case-based approach to teach\ncontemporary statistical and network analysis methods used to\nanalyze data within Systems Biology and Systems Pharmacology research. The\ncourse is appropriate for beginning graduate students and advanced\nundergraduates. Lectures provide background knowledge in understanding the\nproperties of large datasets collected from mammalian cells. In the course we\nwill teach how these datasets can be analyzed to extract new knowledge about\nthe system. Such analyses include clustering, data visualization techniques,\nnetwork construction and visualization, and gene-set enrichment analyses. The\ncourse will be useful for students who encounter large datasets in their own\nresearch, typically genome-wide and would like to learn different methods to\nunderstand such data. The course will teach the students how to use existing\nsoftware tools such as those developed by the <a href=\"http://www.mssm.edu/research/labs/maayan-laboratory\">Ma\u2019ayan Laboratory</a> at Mount\nSinai, but also other freely available software tools. In addition the course\nrequires the students to write short scripts in Python.

{"about_the_course": "<p>Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. This course explains the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to correctly use them. Students will learn how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions and how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. We will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two or more parties generate a shared secret key. We will cover the relevant number theory and discuss public-key encryption and basic key-exchange.&nbsp;Throughout the course students will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field.</p>\n<p>The course will include written homeworks and programming labs. The course is self-contained, however it will be helpful to have a basic understanding of discrete probability theory.</p>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/crypto/large-icon.png", "preview_link": "https://class.coursera.org/crypto-preview/auth/preview", "small_icon_hover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/crypto/small-icon.hover.png", "large_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/crypto/large-icon.png", "video": "0t1oCt88XJk", "university-ids": ["stanford"], "id": 9, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/581cda352d067023dcdcc0d9efd36e/favicon-stanford.ico", "website_facebook": "", "id": 1, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d8/4c69670e0826e42c6cd80b4a02b9a2/stanford.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Palo Alto", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 37.4418834, "location": "Palo Alto, CA, United States", "primary_color": "#8c1515", "abbr_name": "Stanford", "website": "", "description": "The Leland Stanford Junior University, commonly referred to as Stanford University or Stanford, is an American private research university located in Stanford, California on an 8,180-acre (3,310 ha) campus near Palo Alto, California, United States.", "short_name": "stanford", "location_state": "CA", "website_youtube": "", "banner": "", "landing_page_banner": "", "name": "Stanford University", "square_logo": "", "square_logo_source": null, "display": true, "location_lng": -122.14301949999998, "home_link": "http://online.stanford.edu/", "class_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/21/9a0294e2bf773901afbfcb5ef47d97/Stanford_Coursera-200x48_RedText_BG.png", "square_logo_svg": null}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "", "course_syllabus": "", "description": "", "short_name": "crypto", "target_audience": 1, "faq": "<ul>\n<li><strong>Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?</strong>\n<p>Yes.

{"about_the_course": "<p>Computer vision seeks to develop algorithms that replicate one of the most amazing capabilities of the human brain - inferring properties of the external world purely by means of the light reflected from various objects to the eyes. We can determine how far away these objects are, how they are oriented with respect to us, and in relationship to various other objects. We reliably guess their colors and textures, and we can recognize them - this is a chair, this is my dog Fido, this is a picture of Bill Clinton smiling. We can segment out regions of space corresponding to particular objects and track them over time, such as a basketball player weaving through the court.</p>\n<p>In this course, we will study the concepts and algorithms behind some of the remarkable successes of computer vision - capabilities such as face detection, handwritten digit recognition, reconstructing three-dimensional models of cities, automated monitoring of activities, segmenting out organs or tissues in biological images, and sensing for control of robots. We will build this up from fundamentals - an understanding of the geometry and radiometry of image formation, core image processing operations, as well as tools from statistical machine learning. On completing this course a student would understand the key ideas behind the leading techniques for the main problems of computer vision - reconstruction, recognition and segmentation - and have a sense of what computers today can or cannot do.</p>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/vision/large-icon.png", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/vision/small-icon.hover.png", "large_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/vision/large-icon.png", "video": "Dz75hLtCVj0", "university-ids": ["berkeley"], "id": 17, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/39/6375335a0865aa0887bb49e6a5a9ef/favicon-berkeley.ico", "website_facebook": "", "id": 2, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d1/dae7bca6a6161c130f7c7cc58a5522/logo-berkeley-front.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "", "location_country": "", "location_lat": null, "location": "", "primary_color": "", "abbr_name": "Berkeley", "website": "", "description": "The University of California, Berkeley (also referred to as UC Berkeley, Berkeley, California, or simply Cal) is a public research university located in Berkeley, California, United States.", "short_name": "berkeley", "location_state": "", "website_youtube": "", "banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/de/6ebd2e1b04cae30b451a0c743ccd70/banner-berkeley.jpg", "landing_page_banner": null, "name": "University of California, Berkeley", "square_logo": null, "square_logo_source": null, "display": false, "location_lng": null, "home_link": "http://berkeley.edu/", "class_logo": null, "square_logo_svg": null}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "", "course_syllabus": "", "description": "", "short_name": "vision", "target_audience": 0, "faq": "", "category-ids": ["cs-ai"], "visibility": 0, "short_description": "In this course, we will study the concepts and algorithms behind some of the remarkable successes of computer vision - capabilities such as face detection, handwritten digit recognition, reconstructing three-dimensional models of cities and more.", "course_format": "", "has_full_data": true, "social_link": "https://www.coursera.org/course/vision", "suggested_readings": "None is required, as the lectures will be mainly self-contained.

{"about_the_course": "<p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p></p><p>Our relationship to Beethoven is a deep and paradoxical one. For\nmany musicians, he represents a kind of holy grail: His music has an intensity,\nrigor, and profundity which keep us in its thrall, and it is perhaps unequalled\nin the interpretive, technical, and even spiritual challenges it poses to\nperformers. At the same time, Beethoven\u2019s music is casually familiar to\nmillions of people who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musically\ninclined. Two hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture,\nyet still represents its summit.</p>\n\n<p>This course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano sonatas\nfrom the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on one sonata\nand an aspect of Beethoven\u2019s music exemplified by it. (These might include: the\nrelationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the composer; the\ncritical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music; his mixing of\nextremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often surprising ways in\nwhich the events of his life influenced his compositional process and the\ncharacter of the music he was writing.) The course will feature some analysis\nand historical background, but its perspective is that of a player, not a\nmusicologist. Its main aim is to explore and demystify the work of the\nperformer, even while embracing the eternal mystery of Beethoven\u2019s music\nitself.</p>\n\n<p></p>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/21/0e5c188aab1fd78c75197d360c1a11/coursera-lvb.jpg", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c4/474f16f71c8b518170ff1db947ccaf/coursera-lvb.jpg", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/1a/3306f9e902fd6a5a87d3a98696b643/coursera-lvb.jpg", "video": "", "university-ids": ["curtis"], "id": 493, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "CurtisInstitute", "favicon": "", "website_facebook": "CurtisInstitute", "id": 79, "logo": "", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Philadelphia", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 39.952335, "location": "Philadelphia, PA", "primary_color": "#069", "abbr_name": "Curtis", "website": "http://www.curtis.edu/", "description": "The Curtis Institute of Music educates and trains exceptionally gifted young musicians for careers as performing artists on the highest professional level.

This is the most mature and widely used type of machine learning. We will cover the main supervised learning techniques, including decision trees, rules, instances, Bayesian techniques, neural networks, model ensembles, and support vector machines. We will also touch on learning theory with an emphasis on its practical uses. Finally, we will cover the two main classes of unsupervised learning methods: clustering and dimensionality reduction.

{"about_the_course": "<div>You have probably heard that this is the era of \u201cBig Data\u201d. Stories about companies or scientists using data to recommend movies, discover who is pregnant based on credit card receipts, or confirm the existence of the Higgs Boson regularly appear in Forbes, the Economist, the Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times. But how does one turn data into this type of insight? The answer is data analysis and applied statistics. Data analysis is the process of finding the right data to answer your question, understanding the processes underlying the data, discovering the important patterns in the data, and then communicating your results to have the biggest possible impact. There is a critical shortage of people with these skills in the workforce, which is why Hal Varian (Chief Economist at Google) says that being a statistician will be the sexy job for the next 10 years.<br><br>This course is an applied statistics course focusing on data analysis. The course will begin with an overview of how to organize, perform, and write-up data analyses. Then we will cover some of the most popular and widely used statistical methods like linear regression, principal components analysis, cross-validation, and p-values. Instead of focusing on mathematical details, the lectures will be designed to help you apply these techniques to real data using the R statistical programming language, interpret the results, and diagnose potential problems in your analysis. You will also have the opportunity to critique and assist your fellow classmates with their data analyses.</div>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/dataanalysis/large-icon.png", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/dataanalysis/small-icon.hover.png", "large_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/dataanalysis/large-icon.png", "video": "-lutj1vrPwQ", "university-ids": ["jhu"], "id": 61, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "JohnsHopkins", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/80/d81353ccd0bab30962a5770d7aec97/favicon-jhu.ico", "website_facebook": "johnshopkinsuniversity", "id": 8, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cf/0db65d1501244b9e6eacfa5e637fea/logo-jhu-front.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Baltimore", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 39.2903848, "location": "Baltimore, MD", "primary_color": "#0061AA", "abbr_name": "Johns Hopkins", "website": "http://www.jhu.edu/", "description": "The mission of The Johns Hopkins University is to educate its students and cultivate their capacity for life-long learning, to foster independent and original research, and to bring the benefits of discovery to the world.", "short_name": "jhu", "location_state": "MD", "website_youtube": "johnshopkins", "banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/83/94437b11dcbef874ea1f30d960a26b/banner-jhu.jpg", "landing_page_banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c2/544537cee93c0acd67b6573d46a32e/Coursera-banner.jpg", "name": "Johns Hopkins University", "square_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f6/4798f308d4eaa66fc53e99a92d65e5/JHU_360x360.png", "square_logo_source": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/39/7f8dfbe935fe6b3f1eb2e85e307375/JHU_360x360.png", "display": true, "location_lng": -76.61218930000001, "home_link": null, "class_logo": "", "square_logo_svg": ""}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "http://coursera-course-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/a9/61acb25a805dbaf8da2f498acae5bd/logo-jhu-course.png", "course_syllabus": "", "description": "", "short_name": "dataanalysis", "target_audience": 1, "faq": "<ul>\n<li><strong>How is this course different from \u201c<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/compdata\" target=\"_blank\">Computing for Data Analysis</a>\u201d?</strong>\n<p>This course will focus on how to plan, carry out, and communicate analyses of real data sets.

{"about_the_course": "This is a course aimed at making you a better designer. The course marries\ntheory and practice, as both are valuable in improving design performance.\nLectures and readings will lay out the fundamental concepts that underpin\ndesign as a human activity. Weekly design challenges test your ability\nto apply those ideas to solve real problems. The course is deliberately\nbroad - spanning all domains of design, including architecture, graphics,\nservices, apparel, engineered goods, and products. The emphasis of the\ncourse is the basic design process: define, explore, select, and refine.\nYou, the student, bring to the course your particular interests and expertise\nrelated to, for instance, engineering, furniture, fashion, architecture,\nor products. In prior sessions of the course about half of the participants\nwere novices and about half had prior professional design expertise. Both\ngroups seem to benefit substantially from the course. All project work\nis evaluated by your peers -- and indeed, you will also be a peer reviewer.\nThis format allows you to see an interesting collection of projects while\ngetting useful feedback on your own project.\n<br>\n<br>\n<span>Student Testimonials from the First Session of the Course:\n    <br>\n\"An amazing course - a joy to take.

She is also the director/goddess\nof two science organizations related to AIDS, the <a href=\"http://www.cfar.emory.edu/vdc/\">Vaccine Dinner Club</a> (official motto:\n\u201cHot Food, Cool Science \u2026 Count Me In!\u201d) and the CFAR Network Pizza Party\n(official motto: \u201cBetter Science Through Pizza\u201d). Over the course of almost\nthree decades she has worked variously as a community educator, patient\neducator, medical educator, science educator, and research mentor in the field\nof HIV/AIDS.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Hagen\u2019s entry\ninto AIDS came in 1985, only four years into the epidemic, when she began\nvolunteering as a community educator at <a href=\"http://www.aidatlanta.org/page.aspx?pid=295\">AID Atlanta</a>, one of the\nnation's first AIDS service organizations. In 1988 she joined the&nbsp;Emory School of Medicine&nbsp;as a medical educator for Emory\u2019s first AIDS-specific grant, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.seatec.emory.edu/index.html\">Southeast AIDS Training and\nEducation Center</a> (SEATEC). Because, in the early days of the epidemic,\nalmost all practicing doctors, nurses, dentists, and other health care providers&nbsp;had finished their training before the advent\nof AIDS, SEATEC was charged with teaching&nbsp;health profession students and practitioners in a four\nstate area how to provide care for patients with HIV while protecting\nthemselves physically and emotionally.</p>\n\n<p>In 1988 Dr. Hagen also began working as a patient educator in\nthe newly formed <a href=\"http://www.gradyhealth.org/clinic/63/\">Grady Memorial\nHospital Infectious Disease Program</a> (IDP). Although the majority of the\n5,000 patients that the IDP now sees annually are fully versed in the latest\nresearch about HIV treatment, in the IDP\u2019s earliest days most of the patients\nthat Dr. Hagen worked with had never even heard of the disease that was making\nthem sick.</p>\n\n<p>In 1998 Emory University received its first funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for a Center for AIDS Research (CFAR)&nbsp;to expand the depth and breadth of HIV/AIDS research taking place at the University\nand Dr. Hagen was recruited help organize the new Center. At CFAR\nshe fosters multidisciplinary linkages; produces a weekly electronic newsletter, the <a href=\"http://www.cfar.emory.edu/lincs/communication/news.html\"><i>Network News</i></a>; helps bring new faculty into AIDS\nresearch; and assists junior faculty in developing their HIV/AIDS research\ncareers. She also works on contract with the CDC to provide workforce\ndevelopment training for HIV/AIDS medical staff in Africa, supervises\ngraduate student research on HIV/AIDS, and is a member of the City of Atlanta Jurisdictional HIV Prevention Planning Group and the Ryan White Outside Review Committee for the State of Georgia.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Hagen is the recipient of two of the highest honors that\nEmory University&nbsp;can bestow: the Emory Award of Distinction and Teacher of the Year.&nbsp; She has made it her life\u2019s work to help\npeople understand the complexity of HIV/AIDS.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>", "small_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/7f/1ec88b36be9d908c96352c2d85da36/hiv-nologo.png", "course-ids": [970218], "display": true, "recommended_background": "<p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p>This course does not assume any prior knowledge of, or\ncoursework in, HIV/AIDS.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p></p>"}

Or should we construe self-knowledge in a way not crucially relying on a perceptual model? In that case, what other model might we use? Second, Why is it such a big deal? We shall inquire into the question why self-knowledge should be thought so important. Just what, if anything, is missing from a person lacking in self-knowledge that makes her significantly less wise, virtuous, or able than others who have this capacity?

{"about_the_course": "This course introduces the cornerstones of functional programming using the Scala programming language. Functional programming has become more and more popular in recent years because it promotes code that\u2019s safe, concise, and elegant. Furthermore, functional programming makes it easier to write parallel code for today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s multiprocessors by replacing mutable variables and loops with powerful ways to define and compose functions. <br><br> Scala is a language that fuses functional and object-oriented programming in a practical package. It interoperates seamlessly with Java and its tools. Scala is now used in a rapidly increasing number of open source projects and companies. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Tumblr, and Klout. <br><br> In this course you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for reasoning about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing of execution symbolically. <br><br> The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them.

He has been working on programming languages for most of his career. He first studied structured and object-oriented programming as a PhD student of Niklaus Wirth, then fell in love with functional programming while working as a post doc at IBM and Yale. When Java came out, he started to add functional programming constructs to the new platform. This led to Pizza and GJ and eventually to Java 5 with generics. During that time he also developed javac, the current reference compiler for Java. <br><br> Over the last 10 years, Martin worked on unifying object-oriented and functional programming in the Scala language. Scala quickly escaped from the research lab and became a popular open source tool and industrial language. He now oversees development of Scala as head of the programming group at EPFL and as chairman of the Typesafe company.", "small_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/progfun/small-icon.hover.png", "course-ids": [308, 970457], "display": true, "recommended_background": "<div>You should have at least one year programming experience.

{"about_the_course": "<div>This course covers our evolutionary history across more than seven million years, from our origins among the apes up to the biological changes that are still unfolding today. If you enroll, you'll encounter the evidence for the earliest members of our lineage, as they begin the long pathway to humanity. You'll see how scientists are learning about the diets of ancient people, using microscopic evidence and chemical signatures in ancient teeth. We will explore together the exciting fossil discoveries of the last ten years, which have shaken up our notions of the origin of human culture and our own genus.&nbsp;<br><br>Genomics has fundamentally transformed the way we understand our evolution, in many ways opening the direct evidence of our history to anyone. The course will teach you how to look inside the genomes of humans, Neandertals and other ancient people.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have used personal genomics to get your own genotypes, the course will guide you in connecting&nbsp;genetics&nbsp;to your ancestry among ancient humans.<br><br>The course brings a special focus on the rapid evolutionary changes of the last 10,000 years. You'll learn about the consequences of our shift to agriculture, and the ways that people of industrialized nations are still changing today.&nbsp;At the end, we trek forward to anticipate what evolutionary changes may be in store for humanity in the future, using our knowledge of history and scientific understanding to inform our speculations.</div>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/30/3f42d745f5b6a3d0ac7a4c7ce834bc/amud-ohalo-vienna.jpg", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/4c/de0fc51308f7dedd6a3e06012cc61f/amud-ohalo-vienna.jpg", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/4a/14fb96da2a865e6b4f71fe8beb1181/amud-ohalo-vienna.jpg", "video": "", "university-ids": ["wisconsin"], "id": 425, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "uwmadison", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/e4/4fd5046adaccc8414bb742946bcdba/uwcrest_web_sm_shado.png", "website_facebook": "uwmadison", "id": 65, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/0f/43d679f16be0150327575eb2440f1e/UWlogo_fl_4c.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Madison", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 43.0730517, "location": "Madison, WI", "primary_color": "#b70101", "abbr_name": "UW-Madison", "website": "http://www.wisc.edu/", "description": "In achievement and prestige, the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison has long been recognized as one of America's great universities.

{"about_the_course": "Neural networks use learning algorithms that are inspired by our understanding of how the brain learns, but they are evaluated by how well they work for practical applications such as speech recognition, object recognition, image retrieval and the ability to recommend products that a user will like. As computers become more powerful, Neural Networks are gradually taking over from simpler Machine Learning methods. They are already at the heart of a new generation of speech recognition devices and they are beginning to outperform earlier systems for recognizing objects in images. The course will explain the new learning procedures that are responsible for these advances, including effective new proceduresr for learning multiple layers of non-linear features, and give you the skills and understanding required to apply these procedures in many other domains. <br><br> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyzOUbkUf3M\">This YouTube video</a> gives examples of the kind of material that will be in the course, but the course will present this material at a much gentler rate and with more examples.", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/neuralnets/large-icon.png", "preview_link": "https://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001/lecture/preview", "small_icon_hover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/neuralnets/small-icon.hover.png", "large_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/neuralnets/large-icon.png", "video": "KuPai0ogiHk", "university-ids": ["utoronto"], "id": 77, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "uoftnews", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/8e/773801b870a0cb946698134a77417d/favicon-utoronto.ico", "website_facebook": "universitytoronto", "id": 11, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/78/334b4573e06c876cff8e2484f082d7/logo-utoronto-front.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Toronto", "location_country": "CA", "location_lat": 43.653226, "location": "Toronto, ON, Canada", "primary_color": "#1c3361", "abbr_name": "U of T", "website": "http://www.utoronto.ca/", "description": "Established in 1827, the University of Toronto has one of the strongest research and teaching faculties in North America, presenting top students at all levels with an intellectual environment unmatched in depth and breadth on any other Canadian campus.", "short_name": "utoronto", "location_state": "ON", "website_youtube": "universitytoronto", "banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/6f/9a578312b814f8aeaf942f4f248447/banner-utoronto.jpg", "landing_page_banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/84/774219ef720c726661c682cda7838a/UofT-Banner.jpg", "name": "University of Toronto", "square_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/04/1df8943d27a485a986a3ebf10c83d9/UofT-Crest-Square.png", "square_logo_source": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dd/cf4561b10afb34d449bb9574ecbca3/UofT-Crest-Square.png", "display": true, "location_lng": -79.38318429999998, "home_link": null, "class_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/e0/c3219157fdcd439fb3b765c4b723e5/UofT-Crest-Wide.png", "square_logo_svg": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/06/0e2fff91e34df097bbb12ecd57c0af/UofT-Crest-Square.svg"}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "", "course_syllabus": "", "description": "", "short_name": "neuralnets", "target_audience": 1, "faq": "<ul>\n<li><strong>Will I get a certificate after completing this class?</strong>\n<p>Yes.

Dr. Wirth joined Georgia Institute of Technology in 2008. She taught face-to-face for 12 years at an institution of higher learning before she joined Georgia Tech. As an Instructional Designer, she used the ASSURE model of instructional design to assist faculty in developing their online courses. Her in-depth knowledge of how students seek help in an online class from her doctoral research entitled \u201cHelp Seeking in an OnlineEnvironment\u201d has helped shape and create more robust online courses and more positive learner-based performance outcomes. In 2008, she helped successfully write a NASA CAN proposal. Georgia Tech Professional Education was awarded the 5 year almost $3 million NASA CAN in early 2009. Based on this award, she created the basic structure of the NASA ePDN online courses. These courses are offered for free to all middle school STEM teachers who are U.S. citizens in the United States and around the world. The NASA ePDN courses are collaborative in nature and are based on group work. In addition to creating the online&nbsp;structure, she has been teaching one of the online NASA ePDN Technology Integration Certificate courses for three years. She is also a certified Quality Matters Peer Reviewer. She has presented at a number of conferences based on the continuing research that she conducts with the NASA ePDN courses.

{"about_the_course": "<div>Gamification is the application of digital game design techniques to non-game problems, such as business and social impact challenges. Video games are the dominant entertainment form of our time because they are powerful tools for motivating behavior. Effective games leverage both psychology and technology, in ways that can be applied outside the immersive environments of games themselves. Gamification as a business practice has exploded over the past two years. Organizations are applying it in areas such as marketing, human resources, productivity enhancement, sustainability, training, health and wellness, innovation, and customer engagement. Game thinking means more than just dropping in badges and leaderboards; it requires a thoughtful understanding of motivation and design techniques.

Given the novelty of the course and the massive open online format, I didn\u2019t feel I could implement a gamified system that was technically feasible and supportive of the learning experience in the available timeframe. Gamification isn\u2019t a solution for everything, and it\u2019s not always easy to do well! That being said, in the course I\u2019ll discuss examples of educators using gamification in effective ways. And there just might be a game-like aspect or two of the lectures.<br><br> <strong>\u2022 What will I learn from this course?</strong><br><br>That\u2019s largely up to you! The course provides a solid introduction to the concepts and practices of gamification, which can be applied in a number of ways. You\u2019ll be able to think about applying gamification to your business or your life, and to connect gamification with other fields such as marketing, strategy, IT, psychology, and design. And hopefully you\u2019ll see video games in a whole new light.<br><br><strong>\u2022 Is this course different than the Session #1 of Gamification on Coursera, which ran from August to October 2012?</strong><br><br>This is another session of the same course. &nbsp;It has been revised to correct errors and&nbsp;update information, but it covers the same material as the Fall 2012 session.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>", "category-ids": ["infotech", "business"], "visibility": 0, "short_description": "Gamification is the application of game elements and digital game design techniques to non-game problems, such as business and social impact challenges.

{"about_the_course": "<div>Clinical problem solving or diagnostic reasoning is the skill that physicians use to understand a patient\u2019s complaints and then to identify a short, prioritized list of possible diagnoses that could account for those complaints. &nbsp;This differential diagnosis then drives the choice of diagnostic tests and possible treatments. Despite striking advances in information technology, clinical problem solving has not yet been effectively replicated by computers, making it essential that clinicians work to develop expertise in this very important skill set. &nbsp;While television shows make this seem like a magical process, work done by cognitive psychologists and medical educators has helped us understand the ways in which expert physicians reason through these difficult problems to help their patients.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>This course will examine the ways physicians think about clinical problem solving and will help participants develop competence in the building blocks of clinical problem solving.

Using an \u201c<span>innovation constraints<i>\u201d</i></span> framework that draws on modern social\nscience research and on insights from business practice, participants will\nlearn how to best manage people (be they co-workers, bosses, customers,\nclients, friends or any other stakeholders) when innovation is the goal.&nbsp;\nWhile we see several examples of technological innovation, we are not focused\non the management of technology.&nbsp;\nInstead, we focus on something much more powerful:&nbsp; understanding and managing the people engaged\nin creation, innovation and positive change, regardless of the context. </span>\n\n<p>The course is\ndesigned to help you answer the following types of questions:</p>\n\n<ul><li>What are the conditions for successful\n     innovation?</li><li>What causes innovation to fail?</li><li>What makes creative people creative?</li><li>How should I manage an innovative team?</li><li>How do I lead an effective brainstorm process?</li><li>What is an innovation portfolio and how can\n     I manage one?</li><li>Why do so many great ideas get killed?</li></ul>\n\n<p><span>The approach in this\nclass will be to treat innovation as the process of <i>generating</i>, <i>assessing</i>,\nand then <i>implementing</i> useful and valuable ideas.&nbsp;

Introduction:&nbsp; Why Everyone Wants Innovation but No One Wants to Change</b><br>We introduce the approach of the class:&nbsp; instead of trying to be innovative, just stop stopping it.&nbsp; We discuss a framework for analyzing the six most common barriers (constraints) that stop innovation.<br><br><b>Week 2:&nbsp; Individual Constraints:&nbsp; Why Most of Us Are More Creative Than We Think</b><br>Psychologists treat innovation as a problem of having creative ideas; we sometimes stop innovation by not \"thinking different\".&nbsp; This week explores the constraints of perception, intellection, and expression and offers strategies for overcoming them.<br><br><b>Week 3:&nbsp; Group Constraints:&nbsp; Why a Brainstorm Meeting Can Be Worse Than No Meeting at All</b><br>Social psychologists treat innovation as a group problem:&nbsp; we often don't get early support for our ideas because of adverse group dynamics.&nbsp; This week looks at the constraints of emotion, culture, and process in groups as well as the environment within which groups work, and looks at ways to overcome them.<br><br><b>Week 4:&nbsp; Organizational Constraints:&nbsp; Why You\u2019ll Never Be a Prophet in Your Own Hometown</b><br>The field of management sees the problem of innovation as one of the organization; organization is the opposite of innovation, after all.&nbsp; This week explores the constraints of strategy, structure, and resources and we explore ways of framing them that will help us to overcome them.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;<b>Week 5:&nbsp; Industry Constraints: If It\u2019s Such a Great Idea, Why Isn\u2019t Our Competitor Doing It?</b><br>An economist view of failed innovation sees it as a problem of adoption; when there's no market to adopt it, it's not an innovation, it's just a creative idea.&nbsp; We look at the constraints of competition, suppliers, and markets and discuss strategies you can use to relax them.<br><br><b>Week 6:&nbsp; Societal Constraints:&nbsp; Why My Innovation Means You Have to Change</b><br>The sociological and anthropological perspective suggests that societies control or obstruct innovations that are deemed as dangerous or contrary to societal values.&nbsp; This week explores the constraints of identity, social control, and history and we will seek an understanding of how we might avoid them. <br><br><b>Week 7:&nbsp; Technological Constraints:&nbsp; How to Take a Really Hard Problem and Make It Completely Impossible</b><br>Engineers and scientists see failed innovation as a failure of technology; if it doesn't work, it's not an innovation.&nbsp; Here we explore the constraints of knowledge, time, and the natural environment.&nbsp; Rather than trying to overcome them, we develop strategies for working within these constraints.<br><br><b>Week 8:&nbsp; When Failure Is Not an Option: Leading an Innovation Strategy</b><br>The final week has us putting the entire model together into the leadership context.&nbsp; We will learn about innovation portfolios and discuss a tested process for moving innovations from ideas to realities.&nbsp;

{"about_the_course": "This course is designed to introduce students to basic microeconomic theory\nat a relatively rapid pace.

The course will not deal directly with standard \u201cmanagerial economics,\u201d\nwhich tends to emphasize the mathematics and statistical techniques used\nin optimizing firm decisions. However, every effort will be made to apply\nbasic principles to management problems, mainly&nbsp;those relating to\ngetting incentives right for customers, suppliers, workers, managers, and\nowners. Accordingly, this course will focus on an emerging subdiscipline\nwithin economics, <i>organizational economics</i>. It will stress methods\nof thinking, and students will be evaluated on their ability to recall,\nuse, and extend the methods of thinking that are covered during the quarter.\n<br>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/69/f9dfb10683ee4b5b34dc65431c6298/supply-and-demand.gif", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/77/119de16ecd95ce15baccd9f352494d/supply-and-demand.gif", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/4a/7ea0b851569a25e29c2983661ebc1f/supply-and-demand.gif", "video": "Xz1xIRdaX8M", "university-ids": ["uci"], "id": 180, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/33/e75ec0e47204f7a8f928ca487d52ee/logo_uci_rectangle_vector.svg", "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "UCIrvine", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/21/fe2ddd0d8a37bbb16033878eac3d75/16x16_uci.png", "website_facebook": "", "id": 30, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/30/f54378236f5403bb12ad3d06123fa9/logo_uci_rectangle_160x60.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Irvine", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 33.6839473, "location": "Irvine, CA, USA", "primary_color": "#008C44", "abbr_name": "UC Irvine", "website": "http://uci.edu/", "description": "Since 1965, the University of California, Irvine has combined the strengths of a major research university with the bounty of an incomparable Southern California location.

{"about_the_course": "<p>Digital images and videos are everywhere these days \u2013 in thousands of\nscientific (e.g., astronomical, bio-medical), consumer, industrial, and\nartistic applications. Moreover they come in a wide range of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum - from visible light and infrared to gamma rays and\nbeyond. The ability to process image and video signals is therefore an\nincredibly important skill to master for engineering/science students, software\ndevelopers, and practicing scientists.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nDigital image and video processing continues to enable the multimedia\ntechnology revolution we are experiencing today. Some important examples of\nimage and video processing include the removal of degradations images suffer\nduring acquisition (e.g., removing blur from a picture of a fast moving car),\nand the compression and transmission of images and videos (if you watch videos\nonline, or share photos via a social media website, you use this everyday!),\nfor economical storage and efficient transmission.&nbsp;</p>\n\nThis course will cover the fundamentals of image and video processing.&nbsp; We will provide a mathematical framework to describe and analyze images and videos as two- and three-dimensional signals in the spatial, spatio-temporal, and frequency domains. In this class not only will you learn the theory behind fundamental processing tasks including image/video enhancement, recovery, and compression - but you will also learn how to perform these key processing tasks in practice using state-of-the-art techniques and tools. We will introduce and use a wide variety of such tools \u2013 from optimization toolboxes to statistical techniques.

{"about_the_course": "<p>This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.</p>\n<p>The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.</p>\nAn optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java.<br>I hope you enjoy the course!\n<p><strong>Why Study Compilers?</strong></p>\nEverything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly.\n<div></div>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/compilers/large-icon.png", "preview_link": "https://class.coursera.org/compilers//lecture/preview", "small_icon_hover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/compilers/small-icon.hover.png", "large_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/compilers/large-icon.png", "video": "sm0QQO-WZlM", "university-ids": ["stanford"], "id": 16, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/581cda352d067023dcdcc0d9efd36e/favicon-stanford.ico", "website_facebook": "", "id": 1, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d8/4c69670e0826e42c6cd80b4a02b9a2/stanford.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Palo Alto", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 37.4418834, "location": "Palo Alto, CA, United States", "primary_color": "#8c1515", "abbr_name": "Stanford", "website": "", "description": "The Leland Stanford Junior University, commonly referred to as Stanford University or Stanford, is an American private research university located in Stanford, California on an 8,180-acre (3,310 ha) campus near Palo Alto, California, United States.", "short_name": "stanford", "location_state": "CA", "website_youtube": "", "banner": "", "landing_page_banner": "", "name": "Stanford University", "square_logo": "", "square_logo_source": null, "display": true, "location_lng": -122.14301949999998, "home_link": "http://online.stanford.edu/", "class_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/21/9a0294e2bf773901afbfcb5ef47d97/Stanford_Coursera-200x48_RedText_BG.png", "square_logo_svg": null}], "self_service_course_id": 378, "university_logo": "", "course_syllabus": "", "description": "", "short_name": "compilers", "target_audience": 1, "faq": "<ul>\n<li><strong>Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?</strong>\n<p>Yes.

As a rough guide, you should already be an experienced programmer and be comfortable writing substantial C++ or Java programs; writing a compiler is not a good way to learn either programming or these particular languages. The project also makes use of software tools, so you should also be comfortable learning to use new tools on your own.

{"about_the_course": "<p>In this class we will cover the essentials of genomics to help you better\nunderstand your own life (know thy genome, know thyself), and how advances in\nbiotechnology are radically changing the scientific landscape.</p>\n\n<p>We will begin with some of the most basic issues\nof genetics, such as the composition of genomes and how the information in them\nis processed so we can get an adult human from an egg. Then we\u2019ll see that much\nof the power of genomics is in comparisons. If I only had your genome there's\nnot much I could do with it. But if I lined it up against a chimpanzee genome\nI\u2019d see that they are 98.5% identical. It\u2019s that 1.5% difference that we study to\ndetermine what makes a chimp a chimp and a human a human.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>In the next few years you\u2019ll be able\nto get your genome done for a few hundred dollars, and we will look at the\nchallenges you might face dealing with this new self-knowledge. We shall\nparticularly focus on behavior. How can genes predispose some of us to be nice\nand others of us to be psychopaths? We will be examining behavior as a complex\nunfolding of interactions between your genome and the environment. </p>\n\nThanks in large part to genomics we are\nbeginning to understand the living processes that constitute ourselves, where\nwe can begin to intervene to take control of our own future. We will look at\nthe technologies involved and the consequences of this new power. Genetic\nengineering has already changed what you eat and the medicines you take, and will\nlikely therefore change how long you live. If we choose to genetically engineer\nourselves as some advocate then we may also change how we view ourselves as\nhuman beings. We do not know where our ability to intervene in our own living\nprocesses is going to lead us. Depending on your point of view that is the\npromise or the threat of the era we live in.

{"about_the_course": "<p>This is a survey course in modern world history for\nstudents, beginning or advanced, who wish to better understand how the world\ngot to be the way it is today.

This course can therefore\nbe essential for students in many fields, a base equipping them with tools for\nlifelong learning.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>In its current form, the course on Coursera is not offered\nfor college credit. But it is a vital part of the for credit course on this\ntopic being offered at the University of Virginia in the spring semester of\n2013. Both the Coursera and the UVA students will use the same online material as\na common foundation for their different learning experiences.&nbsp; This is the material to survey 'what\nhappened' and the big questions about how to explain so many changes \u2013 some of\nthose questions that start with:&nbsp;\n\"Why?\"&nbsp; (The students in\nthe UVA course then supplement this online material with a lot of additional\nreading, research projects about the histories of particular communities around\nthe world, in-person tutorials and discussions both with me and with their\ngraduate teaching assistants, and examinations.) </p>\n\n<p>It is tempting to think that if we can just understand the\nbig patterns, we don't have to get too caught up in the details. In this\ncourse, though, we care about chronology. We care about individuals. Without some\ncareful attention to sequences of cause and effect, without tracing how big\nchanges come from the choices made by particular people, history can turn into\njust a series of descriptions, a somewhat tiresome recitation of one thing\nafter another. Not this course. So a big part of what we will do is not only\noffer a set of remarkable stories, but also offer you training in how to\nanalyze a situation and&nbsp;how to think about problems of explaining change.</p>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/53/8222e51c172488b83cb9b707f35145/Flag-Globe.png", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/42/08338b124dd8165f27ea86fc99f569/Flag-Globe.png", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d2/0daecfe0161d8305452f9650ea2eaf/Flag-Globe.png", "video": "4lEfKSC1mss", "university-ids": ["uva"], "id": 132, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ba/8cf6b18a752fa9ba66be05d904571d/favicon-uva.ico", "website_facebook": "", "id": 18, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d4/a193b107772ef0132965d063f454f5/uvalogo-coursera.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Charlottesville", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 38.0293059, "location": "Charlottesville, VA", "primary_color": "#212659", "abbr_name": "Virginia", "website": "", "description": "", "short_name": "uva", "location_state": "VA", "website_youtube": "", "banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d0/60eab4b04a9acfbbaf95f829cae2f0/banner-uva.jpg", "landing_page_banner": "", "name": "University of Virginia", "square_logo": "", "square_logo_source": null, "display": true, "location_lng": -78.47667810000002, "home_link": null, "class_logo": "", "square_logo_svg": null}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": null, "course_syllabus": "<p>In the outline that follows, the chronological periods being\ncovered are approximate:<br></p>\n\n<p></p><p></p><p><span>1. <b>Week of January 14:</b> From the Traditional to the Modern:&nbsp;Commercial\nand Military Revolutions (1760-1800)</span></p>\n\n<p><span>2. <b>Week of January 21:</b> Democratic Revolutions of the Atlantic World\n(1760-1800)</span></p>\n\n<p><span>3. <b>Week of January 28:</b> Revolutionary Wars (1800-1830)</span></p>\n\n<p><span>4. <b>Week of February 4:</b> The World Transformed (1830-1870)</span></p>\n\n<p><span>5. <b>Week of February 11:</b> The Rise of National Industrial States\n(1830-1871)</span></p>\n\n<p><span>6. <b>Week of February 18:</b> The Rise of National Industrial Empires\n(1871-1900)</span></p>\n\n<p><span>7. <b>Week of February 25:</b> The Great Acceleration (1890-1910)</span></p>\n\n<p><span>8. <b>Week of March 4:</b> Crackup (1905-1917)</span></p><p>9.<b> WEEK OF MARCH 11&nbsp;- SPRING RECESS</b></p>\n\n<p><span>10.&nbsp;<b>Week of March 18: </b>New Orders Emerge (1917-1930)</span></p>\n\n<p><span>11.&nbsp;<b>Week of March 25:</b> The Crisis of the World (1930-1940)</span></p>\n\n<p><span>12. <b>Week of April 1: </b>Total War and Aftermath (1940-1950)</span></p>\n\n<p><span>13. <b>Week of April 8:</b> The Return of Wartime (1950-1968)</span></p>\n\n<p><span>14. <b>Week of April 15:</b> Decay and Renaissance (1969-1991)</span></p>\n\n<p><span>15. <b>Week of April 22:</b> The Next Phase (1991-2013) &nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p></p>", "description": "", "short_name": "modernworld", "target_audience": 0, "faq": "<strong>Will I get a&nbsp;</strong><b>Statement of Accomplishment for&nbsp;</b><strong>completing this course?<br></strong><p>Yes, further details and requirements&nbsp;will be provided once the course begins.&nbsp;</p>", "category-ids": ["humanities"], "visibility": 0, "short_description": "This is a survey of modern history from a global perspective.

So how do we make sense of organizations and the challenges they face, let alone develop means of managing them in desired directions? While every detail can matter, some matter more than others. This is why we rely on organizational theories -- to focus our attention and draw out relevant features in a sensible way.<br><br>Through this course you will come to see that there is nothing more practical than a good theory.

{"about_the_course": "<p>Throughout history, the vast majority of people around the globe have\n    believed they have, however defined, a \u201csoul.\u201d While the question of whether\n    the soul exists cannot be answered by <span>science, what\nwe can study are the causes and consequences of various <i>beliefs </i>about\nthe soul and its prospects of surviving the death of the body. Why are soul and\nafterlife beliefs so common in human history? Are there adaptive advantages to\nassuming souls exist?&nbsp; Are there brain\nstructures that have been shaped by environmental pressures that provide the\nfoundation of body/mind dualism that is such a prominent feature of many\nreligions? How do these beliefs shape the worldviews of different cultures and\nour collective lives? What is the role of competing afterlife beliefs in\nreligion, science, politics, and war? This course explores several facets of\nthis relatively unexplored but profoundly important aspect of human thought and\nbehavior.</span>\n</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/e0/bdf8651505657ac79281e160a8dd6a/BD_Mummy_and_Ba.jpg", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/71/222b0df7612fb28c3fd36cfebf1957/BD_Mummy_and_Ba.jpg", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/73/a6fe18dbaaba26c95aa2ea00b0be1a/BD_Mummy_and_Ba.jpg", "video": "Y2ZzHxtfGHI", "university-ids": ["rutgers"], "id": 456, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "", "favicon": "", "website_facebook": "", "id": 67, "logo": "", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Camden", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 39.9259463, "location": "Camden, NJ", "primary_color": "", "abbr_name": "Rutgers", "website": "http://www.rutgers.edu/", "description": "", "short_name": "rutgers", "location_state": "NJ", "website_youtube": "", "banner": "", "landing_page_banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/59/a107424bb3b0befa13a7cdd26a9a67/1280320px-v2.jpg", "name": "Rutgers University", "square_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2a/5d3c520f1aeb9edfb86a3acbbda9b1/360px.png", "square_logo_source": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/23e841ad9082e89831838b9065dac1/360px.jpg", "display": true, "location_lng": -75.11961989999998, "home_link": null, "class_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/35/06793b9429f2bb7fa481c88824dadf/200px48px.png", "square_logo_svg": ""}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "", "course_syllabus": "<p><b>Unit 1:&nbsp; Historical Foundations of Science, Religion,\nand Worldviews</b>\n</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction to the Course (Profs.

{"about_the_course": "<p><b></b>While the human genome sequence has\ntransformed our understanding of human biology, it isn\u2019t just the sequence of\nyour DNA that matters, but also how you use it! How are some genes activated\nand others are silenced? How is this controlled? The answer is epigenetics. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Epigenetics has been a hot topic for research\nover the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control\ncontributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are heritable\nthrough cell division, and in some instances are able to behave similarly to\nmutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic mutations,\nepigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the potential to be\nmanipulated therapeutically.

Bloomfield is Professor of Physics at the University of Virginia, where he has been teaching since 1985. Bloomfield grew up taking everything apart and, with the notable exception of one recalcitrant mechanical clock, he managed to get them all back together again (or at least that's what he remembers). He also survived numerous electrical shocks and chemical accidents in his youth, not all of which were unexpected. When he arrived at Amherst College, tinkering with things wasn't offered as a major, so he chose the closest available option: he majored in physics. Bloomfield received his B.A. in 1979 summa cum laude and his Ph.D. in physics from Stanford University in 1983. He was a postdoctoral fellow at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories until 1985, when he joined the faculty of the University of Virginia as an Assistant Professor of Physics. He has been there ever since. Bloomfield is the recipient of numerous awards for his research in atomic, condensed matter, and optical physics, including the Apker Award of the American Physical Society, a Presidential Young Investigator Award of the National Science Foundation, a Young Investigator Award of the Office of Naval Research, and an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, and he is a Fellow of the American Physical Society.&nbsp;\n<div><br>In 1991, Bloomfield decided to try teaching physics the way he originally learned physics: in the context of everyday things. He created a course called How Things Work and taught it to 92 students at the University of Virginia its first semester. He was hooked and evidently so were the students, because 261 of them took the course its second semester. Since then, Bloomfield has taught physics to nearly ten thousand non-science students at the University and received both a 1998 State of Virginia Outstanding Faculty Award and the 2001 Pegram Medal of the Southeastern Section of the American Physical Society for that teaching. His course became an innovative introductory textbook entitled How Things Work: The Physics of Everyday Life, 4th Edition (Wiley, 2010) and that textbook became a more comprehensive trade book entitled How Everything Works: Making Physics Out of the Ordinary (Wiley, 2008). In addition to his books, Bloomfield is the author of more than 100 publications in the fields of atomic clusters, autoionizing states, high-resolution laser spectroscopy, nonlinear optics, computer science, and general science literacy. <br><br>Bloomfield works extensively with professional societies and the media to explain physics to the general public and has appeared frequently on television and radio. He recently co-hosted the television series Some Assembly Required on the Discovery Channel (2007-2008), followed by appearances in Known Universe on the National Geographic Channel (2009) and in Capitals Red Line on Comcast SportsNet (2010-2012). Although he enjoys the challenge of explaining physics on the small screen, he is well aware that he is not an actor and that he merely plays one on television. <br><br>Bloomfield's years of experimenting with everything he can get his hands on, and reading about those he can't, have made him something rare in modern day science: a generalist. More specifically, he knows enough to be dangerous in a broad swath of the physical sciences and even some of the life sciences. That background has allowed him to serve frequently as a science consultant and as an expert witness in matters that require a broad understanding of physics and scientific issues. Although Bloomfield struggles to keep his research, teaching, and service activities from consuming every available second, he has too much fun with all of them to stop.</div>", "small_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/howthingswork1/small-icon.hover.png", "course-ids": [388], "display": true, "recommended_background": "None."}

{"about_the_course": "<p>Phones, diesel engines, animated newspapers, medical devices, games, political campaigns, medical research, mining, transportation systems, ... and so on, and on, and on... every day more of the world around us is at least partly run by computer programs. This means that being able to design programs - or at least be able to work with people who design programs - is becoming a more and more valuable skill.</p>\n\n<p>To build your own programs you need to know two things: how to use the specific programming language and libraries needed, and the more general skill of how to design a program.</p>\n\n<p>This course presents a <b>design method</b> that will enable you to approach the design of complex programs systematically. The method will work for programs in this course as\nwell as hard to design programs you develop in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Using this method you will learn how to model the information in a problem domain, how to structure program data to mirror that information and how to further structure the data to lead to a well organized program. You will also learn to distinguish those parts of a program that are naturally data driven, from those that should use an alternative algorithmic approach. The method uses unit-tests to both produce a better developed design, and to test your program\nas you develop it.</p>\n\n<p>The course has a two-phase structure.

Nous tenterons \u00e9galement de montrer les apports de la th\u00e9ologie de Calvin (notamment la compr\u00e9hension renouvel\u00e9e d\u2019un Dieu en qui l\u2019humain peut faire confiance) et ses limites (par exemple la doctrine dite de la pr\u00e9destination).<br>Ce cours d\u2019introduction fera \u00e9galement une place \u00e0 l\u2019histoire du calvinisme en Europe (France, Allemagne, Provinces-Unies, Angleterre) et dans le monde (Am\u00e9rique, Afrique du Sud, Asie).<br><i>Le cours est donn\u00e9 en fran\u00e7ais avec sous-titres en anglais.<br>---<br></i>Who was John Calvin? Why were his ideas so influential in the 16th century and well beyond his time? This course seeks to answer these two questions.<br>We will present his humanistic leanings, his interpretation of the Bible, his theological vision, his acute sense of social and political questions. We will consider his contribution to culture, how he contributed to shaping French language, his understanding of the human before God and in society. The course will address how Calvin sought to transform the city of Geneva into an idea and an ideal of Christian life, by thinking the meaning of work and money, but also by creating educational and ecclesiastical institutions (the \u00ab&nbsp;Company of Pastors&nbsp;\u00bb, the \u00ab&nbsp;Consistory&nbsp;\u00bb and the \u00ab&nbsp;Academy&nbsp;\u00bb)<br>The course will locate Calvin within the history of religious toleration, or rather of religious intolerance. We will analyse the fate of Michel Servet, a learned Spanish man who was condemned for heresy and executed in Geneva in 1553. With regard to Calvin\u2019s theology, we will show both his lasting contribution (especially his understanding of a God in whom one may trust) as well as the limitations of his thought (for instance his doctrine of predestination).<br>Towards the end of this introductory course, we will turn our attention to the history of Calvinism in Europe (France, Germany, the United Provinces, England) and in various parts of the world (Americas, South Africa and Asia).<br><i>Course in French with English subtitles.</i><br>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/e5/1561248f3efdb3ed0e08c1b91de5fb/Calvin.jpg", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/f06ad4d4410fb8b0f8a75004f7e393/Calvin.jpg", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/9b/74b1b58f6ad5183a369ef568aaad29/Calvin.jpg", "video": "", "university-ids": ["unige"], "id": 385, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "UNIGEnews", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2d/ced013338cdff809fbdde5a24f3354/UNIGE-SmallIcon-16x16.png", "website_facebook": "unigeneve", "id": 49, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/98/a4770a9c65f63ea149919431ad519e/UNIGE-Logo-MainPage.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Gen\u00e8ve", "location_country": "CH", "location_lat": 46.1983922, "location": "Geneva, Suisse", "primary_color": "#CF0063", "abbr_name": "UNIGE", "website": "http://www.unige.ch/", "description": "Founded in 1559, the University of Geneva (UNIGE) is one of Europe's leading universities.

{"about_the_course": "Why Content Strategy is essential for professionals in any organization&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;business, non-profit, or government.<br><br>Content Strategy is a conversation that provides thought-leadership. It starts a \u201cconversation\u201d with users and stakeholders inside and outside an organization.&nbsp; Conversations are the natural way people think about complex issues. Conversations also enable people to develop \u201cstories,\u201d which lead to understanding and helpful mental pictures. Content Strategy practitioners are at all levels of the best enterprises \u2013 in all departments and sectors from the top leader to the newcomer in the ranks.<br><br>In this complex information age, forward-thinking employees know that if they and their organizations are to thrive, they need to go beyond their job descriptions. They must master the most demanding communications frontier \u2013 creating engaging, strategic, honest stories and information that is valued by their most important audiences. In turn that will make their enterprise stand out.<br><br>Regardless of their department, area of work, or expertise, Content Strategy practitioners know how to use words, pictures, video, and social and mobile media to interact with their most important constituents with trustable, actionable information that the audience values and will use. The strategic content they produce enhances the audience\u2019s lives and&nbsp;deepens their understanding and engagement with the organization.<br><br>Content Strategy is similar to the best examples of journalism, but it is done by non-journalism organizations. Content Strategy is always honest, trustable, and transparent. It tells all sides of every story it reports. Often it is also deeper and directed at topics and audiences that traditional journalism under-serves or does not reach at all. Content Strategy is not advertising, marketing, or public relations. It is different because it never pursues the persuasive goals that are appropriate in those disciplines.<br>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/2d/d77f35ab4002efa08e6bc876f0450e/Content-Strategy-logo2.JPG", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a2/5eebe5eaecd87d6eb07304cbd9ef0f/Content-Strategy-logo2.jpg", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/2e/b6ffdd5174cc93bb9b6dbe83b19879/Content-Strategy-logo2.jpg", "video": "", "university-ids": ["northwestern"], "id": 488, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "NorthwesternU", "favicon": "", "website_facebook": "NorthwesternU", "id": 54, "logo": "", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Evanston", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 42.0411414, "location": "Evanston, IL", "primary_color": "#480058", "abbr_name": "Northwestern", "website": "http://www.northwestern.edu/", "description": "Founded in 1851, Northwestern University is a private research and teaching university with an enrollment of approximately 8,000 full-time undergraduate students, 8,000 full-time graduate and professional students, and 2,000 part-time students on campuses in Evanston and Chicago, Illinois, and Doha, Qatar.

{"about_the_course": "<p>Quantum\nphysics is the foundation for much of modern technology, provides the framework\nfor understanding light and matter from the subatomic to macroscopic domains,\nand makes possible the most precise measurements ever made.&nbsp; More than just a theory, it offers a way of\nlooking at the world that grows richer with experience and practice.&nbsp; Our course will provide some of that practice and teach \nyou \"tricks of the trade\" (not found in textbooks) that will enable you \nto solve quantum-mechanical problems yourself and understand the subject\n at a deeper level.</p>\n\n<p>The\nbasic principles of quantum physics are actually quite simple, but they lead to\nastonishing outcomes. &nbsp;Two examples that\nwe will look at from various perspectives are the prediction of the laser by\nAlbert Einstein in 1917 and the prediction of antimatter by Paul Dirac in 1928.&nbsp; Both of these predictions came from very\nsimple arguments in quantum theory, and led to results that transformed science\nand society.&nbsp; Another familiar\nphenomenon, magnetism, had been known since antiquity, but only with the advent\nof quantum physics was it understood how magnets worked, to a degree that made\npossible the discovery in the 1980\u2019s of ultrastrong rare-earth magnets.&nbsp; However, lasers, antimatter and magnets are\nareas of vibrant research, and they are all encountered in the new field of\nultracold atomic physics that will provide much of the material of \u201cExploring\nQuantum Physics\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Richard\nFeynman once said, \u201cI think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum\nmechanics.\u201d&nbsp; We say, that\u2019s no reason not\nto try! What Feynman was referring to are some of the \u201cspooky\u201d phenomena like quantum entanglement, which are incomprehensible from the standpoint of classical physics. Even though they have been thoroughly tested by experiment, and are even being exploited for applications such as cryptography and logic processing, they still seem so counterintuitive that they give rise to extraordinary ideas such as the many-world theory. Quantum physics combines\na spectacular record of discovery and predictive success, with foundational\nperplexities so severe that even Albert Einstein came to believe that it was\nwrong.&nbsp; This is what makes it such an\nexciting area of science!</p><br>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/8c/02c5aee8624624fd81fc6e0f5a8137/Preliminary_Draft_Logo_Clark_Galitski2.png", "preview_link": "https://class.coursera.org/eqp-001/lecture/preview", "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/10/c8ba4de9077e632a9bd311f5323787/Preliminary_Draft_Logo_Clark_Galitski2.png", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c4/1c545de180c31595a29dd0f38bd7cf/Preliminary_Draft_Logo_Clark_Galitski2.png", "video": "YwTE8ldPfak", "university-ids": ["umd"], "id": 170, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "UofMaryland", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/98/81bc9a607b97fadd8a2fdd6b66bfc2/favicon_16x16.ico", "website_facebook": "UnivofMaryland", "id": 32, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/fd/01ba206b961003d2e4eb052d0ceac6/primarylogosm.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "21, Berwyn", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 38.9896967, "location": "College Park, Maryland, USA", "primary_color": "#990000", "abbr_name": "UMD", "website": "http://www.umd.edu/", "description": "The University of Maryland is the state's flagship university and one of the nation's preeminent public research universities.

{"about_the_course": "<p>It is often claimed that relativism, subjectivism and nihilism are\ntypically modern philosophical problems that emerge with the breakdown of\ntraditional values, customs and ways of life. The result is the absence of\nmeaning, the lapse of religious faith, and feeling of alienation that is so\nwidespread in modernity. <br></p><p>The Danish thinker S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813-55) gave\none of the most penetrating analyses of this complex phenomenon. But somewhat\nsurprisingly he seeks insight into it not in any modern thinker but rather in\nan ancient one, the Greek philosopher Socrates. </p>\n\n<p><span>In his famous work <i>The Concept\nof Irony</i> Kierkegaard examines different forms of subjectivism and\nrelativism as they are conceived as criticisms of traditional culture. He\ncharacterizes these different tendencies under the heading of \u201cirony.\u201d He\nrealizes that once critical reflection has destroyed traditional values, there\nis no way to go back. But yet the way forward is uncertain. As the modern\nmovements such as Existentialism, Post-Structuralism and Post-Modernism reveal,\nthe issues that Kierkegaard faced are still among the central problems of\nphilosophy today.</span></p>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/9b/561c5c530133e338c10ffaa3cafe97/kirkegaard.jpg", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/bb/98b4193b2f80f2773d9308992cb490/kirkegaard.jpg", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b4/dd0b26c2c7f9464fb54a52a9061579/kirkegaard.jpg", "video": "", "university-ids": ["ucph"], "id": 402, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "uni_copenhagen", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/55/45a9eafa2bfdb29d961f8472a0b7fa/favicon_fa.ico", "website_facebook": "universitet", "id": 63, "logo": "", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "CPH", "location_country": "DK", "location_lat": 55.6760968, "location": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "primary_color": "#901a1e", "abbr_name": "UCPH", "website": "http://www.ku.dk/english", "description": "The University of Copenhagen is the oldest University in Denmark - founded in 1479, and with over 38,000 students and more than 9,000 employees.

{"about_the_course": "Computer networks from ISPs to WiFi and cellular networks are a key part\nof the information economy. These networks are the foundation for the Web,\nand they enable companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon. This course\nintroduces the fundamental problems of computer networking, from sending\nbits over wires to running distributed applications. For each problem,\nwe explore the design strategies that have proven valuable in practice.\nTopics include error detection and correction, multiple-access, bandwidth\nallocation, routing, internetworking, reliability, quality of service,\nnaming, content delivery, and security. As we cover these topics, you will\nlearn how the internals of the Internet work to support the Web and other\nnetworked applications. You will develop a detailed understanding of widely-used\nnetworking technologies such as TCP/IP, HTTP, 802.11, Ethernet, and DNS.\n<br>\n<br>The course includes an optional sequence of projects that provide concrete\nexperience with networked software implementation. The projects culminate\nin a peer-to-peer social networking application. As many of the problems\nthe Internet must solve to achieve its core functionality must be addressed\nagain by higher layers, the project experience reinforces the lessons of\nthe core course material and relates it to networked application development.\nThe projects target Android phones, although desktop hosting is also supported.", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/comnetworks/large-icon.png", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/comnetworks/small-icon.hover.png", "large_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/comnetworks/large-icon.png", "video": "", "university-ids": ["uw"], "id": 105, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": "", "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/98/7480c1f9271144aa75fe024a1ad5a0/favicon-uw.ico", "website_facebook": "", "id": 15, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/53/2f0ff155b3390e3d7190c363a4a045/uw-logo-coursera-transparent.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Seattle", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 47.6062095, "location": "Seattle, WA", "primary_color": "#38255a", "abbr_name": "Washington", "website": "https://www.washington.edu/", "description": "", "short_name": "uw", "location_state": "WA", "website_youtube": "", "banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/82756d3357ccb0a34484c6dcf02c5e/banner-uw.jpg", "landing_page_banner": "", "name": "University of Washington", "square_logo": "", "square_logo_source": "", "display": true, "location_lng": -122.3320708, "home_link": null, "class_logo": "", "square_logo_svg": ""}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "", "course_syllabus": "", "description": "", "short_name": "comnetworks", "target_audience": 0, "faq": "", "category-ids": ["cs-systems"], "visibility": 0, "short_description": "The Internet is a computer network that millions of people use every day.

{"about_the_course": "<p><b>Early Renaissance Architecture in Italy: from Alberti\nto Bramante</b>\n\n</p>\n<p><span>When\nLeon Battista Alberti completed<i> </i>his\ntreatise about architecture around 1452, his initial study of texts and\nmonuments of Antiquity was based on mathematics and geometry as a reflection of\nnature, with a belief that architecture was a part of a man's civil duty.</span>\n\n</p>\n<p>This<span> attitude would\ncondition the architectural principles of the early Renaissance and architects\ndid not apply themselves to textual imitations of individual antique monuments.\nIn Florence, they preferred to accept and articulate the rational \u201csystem\u201d of\nBrunelleschi, either transforming it, like Alberti, or breaking with<b> </b>it in a return to tradition, like\nMichelozzo. In north and south Italy, the battle between innovation and resistance\nwas increasing in strength and substance because it not only encompassed\nimmediate questions of decorative language&nbsp;\n(antique forms and architectural orders) but also the problems of\nconceiving and constructing an architecture that could replace the gothic\nstructural membering with the continuous masonry of the Antiquity. At first,\nthe new decoration was frequently adapted to the existing architectural system,\nand only later did it find a partner in the different spatial and structural\nconceptions that descended from Florentine exempla. The tendency to see norms\nand models in antique architecture, which must be rigidly replicated, first\naffirmed itself at the beginning of the XVI century in Rome.</span>\n\n</p>\n<p>Through some of the most celebrated examples of the early Renaissance\n    architecture and the most important statements of the early Renaissance\n    theories, the course will examine problems of the architectural spaces,\n    technology and forms in the XV century in Italy, from Leon Battista Alberti\u2019s\n    to Francesco di Giorgio\u2019s and Bramante\u2019s proposals.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/03/e3dc90082e82795783e6b5e031d4b6/77650945.jpg", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/9a/6e4051c4442cd25c8e448634d18c04/77650945.jpg", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/73/c17dacf21ef571074062b31b6de890/77650945.jpg", "video": "", "university-ids": ["sapienza"], "id": 467, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "SapienzaRoma", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/4f/07577f978824782011a597f14f2bdf/favicon-16x16-png.png", "website_facebook": "SapienzaRoma", "id": 74, "logo": "", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Roma", "location_country": "IT", "location_lat": 41.9015141, "location": "Roma, RM, Italia", "primary_color": " #822433", "abbr_name": "Sapienza", "website": "http://www.uniroma1.it/", "description": "Sapienza University of Rome, founded in 1303 by Pope Boniface VIII, is the oldest University in Rome and the largest in Europe.\nSince its founding over 700 years ago, Sapienza has played an important role in Italian history and has been directly involved in key changes and developments in society, economics and politics.

{"about_the_course": "<p><strong>What are Probabilistic Graphical Models?</strong></p>\n<p>Uncertainty is unavoidable in real-world applications: we can almost never predict with certainty what will happen in the future, and even in the present and the past, many important aspects of the world are not observed with certainty. Probability theory gives us the basic foundation to model our beliefs about the different possible states of the world, and to update these beliefs as new evidence is obtained. These beliefs can be combined with individual preferences to help guide our actions, and even in selecting which observations to make. While probability theory has existed since the 17th century, our ability to use it effectively on large problems involving many inter-related variables is fairly recent, and is due largely to the development of a framework known as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This framework, which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces, often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains, which include: web search, medical and fault diagnosis, image understanding, reconstruction of biological networks, speech recognition, natural language processing, decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel, robot navigation, and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations.</p>\nIn this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques; you will also learn algorithms for using a PGM to reach conclusions about the world from limited and noisy evidence, and for making good decisions under uncertainty. The class covers both the theoretical underpinnings of the PGM framework and practical skills needed to apply these techniques to new problems.", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/pgm/large-icon.png", "preview_link": "https://class.coursera.org/pgm//lecture/preview", "small_icon_hover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/pgm/small-icon.hover.png", "large_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/pgm/large-icon.png", "video": "bVMBe50GfnI", "university-ids": ["stanford"], "id": 3, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/581cda352d067023dcdcc0d9efd36e/favicon-stanford.ico", "website_facebook": "", "id": 1, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d8/4c69670e0826e42c6cd80b4a02b9a2/stanford.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Palo Alto", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 37.4418834, "location": "Palo Alto, CA, United States", "primary_color": "#8c1515", "abbr_name": "Stanford", "website": "", "description": "The Leland Stanford Junior University, commonly referred to as Stanford University or Stanford, is an American private research university located in Stanford, California on an 8,180-acre (3,310 ha) campus near Palo Alto, California, United States.", "short_name": "stanford", "location_state": "CA", "website_youtube": "", "banner": "", "landing_page_banner": "", "name": "Stanford University", "square_logo": "", "square_logo_source": null, "display": true, "location_lng": -122.14301949999998, "home_link": "http://online.stanford.edu/", "class_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/21/9a0294e2bf773901afbfcb5ef47d97/Stanford_Coursera-200x48_RedText_BG.png", "square_logo_svg": null}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "", "course_syllabus": "<p><strong>Topics covered include:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Bayesian network and Markov network representation, including extensions for reasoning over domains that change over time and over domains with a variable number of entities</li>\n<li>Reasoning and inference methods, including exact inference (variable elimination, clique trees) and approximate inference (belief propagation message passing, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods)</li>\n<li>Learning parameters and structure in PGMs</li>\n<li>Using a PGM for decision making under uncertainty.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There will be short weekly review quizzes and programming assignments (Octave/Matlab) focusing on case studies and applications of PGMs to real-world problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Credit Scoring and Factors</li>\n<li>Modeling Genetic Inheritance and Disease</li>\n<li>Markov Networks and Optical Character Recognition (OCR)</li>\n<li>Inference: Belief Propagation</li>\n<li>Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Image Segmentation</li>\n<li>Decision Theory:&nbsp;Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia</li>\n<li>Conditional Random Field Learning for OCR</li>\n<li>Structure Learning for Identifying Skeleton Structure</li>\n<li>Human Action Recognition with Kinect</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To prepare for the class in advance, you may consider reading through the following sections of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262013192\" target=\"_blank\">textbook (discount code DKPGM12)</a>&nbsp;by Daphne and Nir Friedman:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Introduction and Overview.&nbsp;</b>Chapters 1, 2.1.1 - 2.1.4, 4.2.1.</li>\n<li><b>Bayesian Network Fundamentals.&nbsp;</b>Chapters 3.1 - 3.3.</li>\n<li><b>Markov Network Fundamentals.&nbsp;</b>Chapters 4.1, 4.2.2, 4.3.1, 4.4, 4.6.1.</li>\n<li><b>Structured CPDs.&nbsp;</b>Chapters 5.1 - 5.5.</li>\n<li><b>Template Models.&nbsp;</b>Chapters 6.1 - 6.4.1.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These will be covered in the first two weeks of the online class.</p>\n<p>The slides for the whole class can be found&nbsp;<a href=\"http://spark-university.s3.amazonaws.com/stanford-pgm/PGM_slides.zip\">here</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"coursera-course-faq\"></div>", "description": "", "short_name": "pgm", "target_audience": 1, "faq": "<ul>\n<li><strong>Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?</strong>\n<p>Yes.

{"about_the_course": "<p>In 2012, the EU received the Nobel Peace Prize for its decades-long\ncontribution to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and\nhuman rights in Europe. War has become virtually unthinkable in the EU. When\nthe first steps towards supranational cooperation - primarily targeted at\npreventing the rearmament of Germany - were made in the aftermath of World War\nTwo, the Founding Fathers of the European integration construct could never\nhave imagined this outcome in their wildest dreams. Over the years, the\nsupranational cooperation would widen - from the original European Communities\nconsisting of 6 Member States to the current Union of 27 Members \u2013 and deepen \u2013\nfrom the originally almost purely economically inspired Communities to the\ncurrent Union with a say in almost all areas of national competence. At the\nsame time, problems with the Euro have plunged the EU in one of the biggest\ncrises since its inception. This challenges lawmakers to tackle difficult questions\nabout the continued existence of the Euro and the future direction of the\nEuropean integration project.</p><p>This course will give the students an insight into the law of the EU, a\nvast and fascinating area of law which forms an integral part of the legal\nsystems of its 27 Member States. The course is divided\ninto three parts. In the first part, we will pay attention to the creation and the development of the EU, its\ninstitutional structure and functioning, and the specific nature and sources of\nEU law. In the second part, we will examine how EU law\nimpacts on the lives of EU citizens as well as on companies that are\nestablished or provide services in the EU. &nbsp;In the final part, we will tackle Europe\u2019s common currency crisis,\ninvestigating causes, effects and possible routes out of this existential\ncrisis of the Union.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a student, lawyer, entrepreneur or simply\ninterested in the EU, its&nbsp;development and legal system, this course will\nprovide you with the foundations.&nbsp;The course is of interest to people both\ninside and outside the European Union: EU citizens may learn how to benefit\nfrom the rights contained in EU life; people from other parts of the world may\nlearn from the EU\u2019s specific set-up, its functioning and the legal solutions\nbeing applied in the European context.</p>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/4a/eb093dc24f8ae7acfbc3e3654c8f28/logo-for-the-class.jpg", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b8/1a384e65c5fc87b2383c7ec27f5f66/logo-for-the-class.jpg", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/3d/6a143d847c8040a7cb547423d6205a/logo-for-the-class.jpg", "video": "qJv6XMFsKwI", "university-ids": ["leiden"], "id": 289, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "UniLeiden", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ee/d18f6f5f5a5372c55cac5bc7f42b2a/ul_icon.gif", "website_facebook": "universiteitleiden", "id": 25, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1e/fb5f794f4823cbc0d36ecf9254e0e6/Wide-logo.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Leiden", "location_country": "NL", "location_lat": 52.1603216, "location": "Leiden, The Netherlands", "primary_color": "#0C2577", "abbr_name": "Leiden", "website": "http://www.leiden.edu/", "description": "Leiden University is one of Europe's foremost research universities.

{"about_the_course": "In this course we will seek to \u201cunderstand Einstein,\u201d especially focusing\non the special theory of relativity that Albert Einstein, as a 26-year-old\npatent clerk, introduced in his so-called \u201cmiracle year\u201d of 1905. Our goal\nwill be to go behind the myth-making and beyond the popularized presentations\nof relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both Einstein\nthe person and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of his\ntheory. Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einstein\ncome up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is the\nmeaning of relativity? What\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d about the special theory of relativity?\nWhy did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean\nto say that time is the \u201cfourth dimension\u201d? Can time actually run more\nslowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending\non their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why can\u2019t things\ntravel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the\ncenter of the galaxy and return in one lifetime?

(Dr. Dave Ward)</b><br> We\u2019ll start the course by thinking about what Philosophy actually is; what makes it different from other subjects? What are its distinctive aims and methods? To help us think about this, we\u2019ll consider a couple of different approaches philosophers have taken to arguably the biggest question of all: what is the Meaning of Life? We\u2019ll then look ahead to some of the different branches of philosophy we\u2019ll be considering on the course. <br><br> <b>Week 2: What do you know? (Professor Duncan Pritchard)</b><br> We know a lot of things \u2013 or, at least, we think we do. Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies knowledge; what it is, and the ways we can come to have it. This week, we\u2019ll take a tour through some of the issues that arise in this branch of philosophy. In particular, we\u2019ll think about what radical scepticism means for our claims to knowledge. How can we know something is the case if we\u2019re unable to rule out possibilities that are clearly incompatible with it? <br><br> <b>Week 3: Are scientific theories true? (Dr. Michela Massimi)</b><br> In this session we will explore a central and ongoing debate in contemporary philosophy of science: whether or not scientific theories are true. Or better, whether a scientific theory needs be 'true' to be good at all. The answer to this question comes in two main varieties. Scientific realists believe that theories ought to be true in order to be good. We will analyse their main argument for this claim (which goes under the name of 'no miracles argument'), and some prominent objections to it. Scientific antirealists, on the other hand, defend the view that there is nothing special about 'truth' and that scientific theories and scientific progress can be understood without appeal to it. The aim of this session is to present both views, their main arguments, and prospects. <br><br> <b>Week 4: Minds, Brains and Computers (Dr. Suilin Lavelle)</b><br> If you\u2019re reading this, then you\u2019ve got a mind. But what is a mind, and what does it take to have one? Should we understand minds as sets of dispositions to behave in certain ways, as patterns of neural activation, or as akin to programmes that are run on the computational hardware of our brains? This week, we\u2019ll look at how and why recent philosophy of mind and psychology has embraced each of these options in turn, and think about the problems and prospects for each. <br><br> <b>Week 5: Morality: Objective, Subjective or Relative? (Dr. Matthew Chrisman)</b><br> We all live with some sense of what is good or bad, some feelings about which ways of conducting ourselves are better or worse. But what is the status of these moral beliefs, senses, or feelings? Should we think of them as reflecting hard, objective facts about our world, of the sort that scientists could uncover and study? Or should we think of moral judgements as mere expressions of personal or cultural preferences? This week we\u2019ll survey some of the different options that are available when we\u2019re thinking about these issues, and the problems and prospects for each. <br><br> <b>Week 6: Should you believe what you hear? (Dr. Allan Hazlett)</b><br> Much of what we think about the world we believe on the basis of what other people say. &nbsp;But is this trust in other people's testimony justified? &nbsp;This week, we\u2019ll investigate how this question was addressed by two great philosophers of the Scottish Enlightenment, David Hume (1711 - 1776) and Thomas Reid (1710 - 1796). &nbsp;Hume and Reid's dispute about testimony represents a clash between two worldviews that would continue to clash for centuries: a skeptical and often secular worldview, eager to question everything (represented by Hume), and conservative and often religious worldview, keen to defend common sense (represented by Reid). <br><br> <b>Week 7: Philosophy and the Structure of Reality (Dr. Alasdair Richmond)</b><br> In our last week we\u2019ll take a brief tour through some of the issues in metaphysics, a branch of philosophy that investigates the ways that reality could intelligibly be. As a case study, we\u2019ll focus on the possibility, or otherwise, of time-travel. Some have thought that the apparent possibility of creating a machine that we could use to transport a person backwards in time can be ruled out just by thinking about it. But is time-travel really logically impossible? What would the universe have to be like for it to be possible? And can we know whether our universe fits the bill?", "description": "", "short_name": "introphil", "target_audience": 0, "faq": "<ul>\n<li><strong>Will I get a certificate after completing this class?</strong>\n<p>Yes.

Practical men, who believe themselves to be\nquite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually slaves of some\ndefunct economist.\u201d This will be the key theme we explore in the course, the\ninfluence of theory and the way that policy responses to events like recession,\nunemployment, inflation and the Global Financial Crisis, reflect that theory.</p>\n\n<p>We will cover\nimportant macroeconomic concepts such as the national accounts, unemployment\nand inflation, explain how the ideas associated with John Maynard Keynes laid\nthe foundation for governments\u2019 active management of the macroeconomy in the\npost war era, and examine the intellectual basis for the monetary and fiscal\npolicy responses to the Global Financial Crisis.&nbsp; Economists\u2019 approaches to the analysis of\nlong run economic growth will also be considered. The approach will be\ncritical. There are few areas of human endeavour that attract so much debate\nand disagreement as the management of a modern industrial economy. We will not\nshy away from those debates. But what we will do is emphasise the systematic\ntheorising that underlies the way macroeconomists and policy makers approach\ntheir task. The aim is to enable those who take the course to become informed\nanalysts of the macroeconomy and of current (and past) macroeconomic policy\ndebates.</p><p><i>Image source: Nilss Olekalns University of Melbourne 2012</i><br></p>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/3b/671b7d05ce0d5ab23fc50a9905e0f0/macro_eco.png", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/bd/5e0555c58ef27ead3a5efaccf00dca/macro_eco.png", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a5/b5eac21583f1e5d7bcdb072739cea2/macro_eco.png", "video": "B-lFM3kuLIg", "university-ids": ["unimelb"], "id": 175, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": "", "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "unimelb", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c2/fc137263568a25c66e2cc5f98ca899/UOM_16x16pxLogo.png", "website_facebook": "melbuni", "id": 33, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/58/59304da07d93c8a2cbfc5ac4c6a269/Mel1.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Melbourne", "location_country": "AU", "location_lat": -37.814107, "location": "Melbourne, Victoria, Australia", "primary_color": "#003366", "abbr_name": "UniMelb", "website": "http://www.unimelb.edu.au/", "description": "", "short_name": "unimelb", "location_state": "VIC", "website_youtube": "", "banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cb/bccd6f6ae45162d05e7dc2a1ed8bc3/928x220_ImageStrip.jpg", "landing_page_banner": "", "name": "University of Melbourne", "square_logo": "", "square_logo_source": "", "display": true, "location_lng": 144.96327999999994, "home_link": null, "class_logo": "", "square_logo_svg": ""}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "", "course_syllabus": "", "description": "", "short_name": "macroeconomics", "target_audience": 0, "faq": "", "category-ids": ["economics"], "visibility": 0, "short_description": " All of us are affected by macroeconomic forces \u2013 they shape the very world we live in.

{"about_the_course": "In this fast-paced course we will read and encounter and discuss a great range of modern and contemporary U.S. poets working in the \"experimental mode,\" starting with the 19th-century proto-modernists Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman and ending with 21st-century conceptual poetics. Aside from providing a perhaps handy or helpful survey and chronology of 20th- and 21st-century poetry, this course offers a way of understanding general cultural transitions from modernism to postmodernism. Some people may wish to enroll as much to gain an understanding of the modernism/postmodernism problem through a study of poetry as to gain access to the work of these many poets. Participants do not need to have any prior knowledge of poetry or poetics. The instructor, Al Filreis, rarely lectures, and frequently calls for \"the end of the lecture as we know it\"; instead, most of the video-recorded lessons will consist of collaborative close readings led by Filreis, seminar-style -- offering models or samples of readers' interpretations of these knotty but powerful poems, aided by the poetry-minded denizens of the Kelly Writers House on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania.", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/modernpoetry/large-icon.png", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/modernpoetry/small-icon.hover.png", "large_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/modernpoetry/large-icon.png", "video": "PUok9h6uvO0", "university-ids": ["penn"], "id": 22, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": "", "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "@pennopencourses", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f3/2ca37fd0d5d009a94e0ba7f284c860/favicon-penn.ico", "website_facebook": "", "id": 6, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7c/5d03cbe2cb87974be7f83cc1080af8/logo-penn-front.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "", "location_country": "", "location_lat": null, "location": "City, State, Country", "primary_color": "#0000ff", "abbr_name": "Penn", "website": "http://provost.upenn.edu/initiatives/openlearning", "description": "The University of Pennsylvania (commonly referred to as Penn or UPenn) is a private university, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.

You do not need to know anything about poetry (modern or otherwise) to thrive in this course. You need only be willing to spend some extra time with a poem that seems difficult at first.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Are there going to be days and times when I need to \"attend\" a live session? Do I need to make myself available to participate at certain times of each week?</strong>\n<p>No. Each week you will be reading some poems, viewing approximately 2 hours of videos (discussions of poems), and participating in the discussion forum whenever you have the time - at whatever time of day you prefer. You will have the option of participating in regularly scheduled live webcast sessions, at certain times; these are a great deal of fun but, again, they are optional and we will immediately provide recordings of the webcasts.<br></p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Do I need to purchase any textbooks for the course?</strong>\n<p>No.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Do you recommend that I read some poetry in order to prepare for the course?</strong>\n<p>Not necessary, but a good idea. Read a few poems by Emily Dickinson and perhaps some of Walt Whitman's \"Song of Myself.\" The works of those two poets are widely available on the web; we will be discussing them in the first week of the course. If you are shopping for books of poetry, we recommend buying a volume of the poems of William Carlos Williams.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>You say the course is \"fast paced.\" Will it move too fast for me?</strong>\n<p>ModPo is \"fast paced\" because we will not spend long on any one poet. This is a \"survey\" course -- covering many poets with the objective of conveying a sense of poetic movements and trends. We will study only a few poets in any depth (Dickinson, Williams, Gertrude Stein, John Ashbery) but otherwise during each week we will typically talk about poems by three or four or even five different poets.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>How do the videos fit into the course? What about discussion forums?</strong>\n<p>Each filmed/recorded discussion will consist of a close reading of a single poem. To prepare, you will merely need to read (and perhaps re-read) that poem. The process should be straightforward: read the poem, watch the video, then participate in discussion forums, take a short quiz (if assigned) or write a short essay (if assigned). The discussion forums are <i>very</i> important in ModPo -- a place to get others' responses to the poems and to ask questions about concepts you don't understand. You should plan to participate in the discussion forums.<br></p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Will there be quizzes as there are in other online courses? Does that make sense in a humanities course?</strong>\n<p>There will be quizzes, yes, but the goal of these is not to ascertain correctness or incorrectness -- but to give you a sense of what ideas you are or are not comprehending from the video discussions, and to underscore which concepts are especially important.</p></li>\n<li><strong>Will a Statement of Accomplishment or \"certificate\" be awarded at the end of ModPo?</strong>\n<p>Yes. But please note that thousands have enjoyed ModPo - and being part of the ModPo community - without taking the certificate. To earn a Statement of Accomplishment, ModPo students must (1) write and submit all four essays; (2) submit at least four peer reviews of others' essays for each of the four essay assignments (a total of at least 16 peer reviews); (3) complete all the quizzes and receive a score of greater than zero on each; (4) participate in the discussions (in the discussion forums) of at least one of our poems in each of the ten weeks.\n</p></li></ul>", "category-ids": ["humanities"], "visibility": 0, "short_description": "ModPo is a fast-paced introduction to modern and contemporary U.S. poetry, from Dickinson and Whitman to the present.

{"about_the_course": "<p>Statistical Molecular Thermodynamics is a course in physical chemistry\nthat relates the microscopic properties of molecules to the macroscopic behavior\nof chemical systems. Quantized molecular energy levels and their use in the\nconstruction of molecular and ensemble partition functions is described.\nThermodynamic state functions, their dependence on the partition function, and\ntheir relationships with one another (as dictated by the three Laws of\nThermodynamics) are all examined in detail. Analysis and demonstration takes\nplace primarily in the context of ideal and real gases. This eight-week course\ncovers slightly more than half of a typical semester-long course in chemical\nthermodynamics. Typical topics to be addressed subsequently would be phase\nequilibria, liquids, solutions of non-electrolytes and electrolytes, and\nchemical reaction equilibria. <br></p><p>Students\n who successfully complete the course will be able to predict how \nchanges in molecular properties will influence the macroscopic behavior \nof those substances; they will understand the relationships between \nenergy, heat, and work, and be able to predict how much work can be \nextracted from a given chemical process under various sets of \nconditions; they will understand the role of entropy in physical and \nchemical processes; and they will be able to engineer conditions to make\n chemical reactions spontaneously favorable (or not). Students will also\n become adept with differential calculus as a tool to derive and \nmanipulate relationships between connected thermodynamic variables and \nstate functions.<br></p>\n<br>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ea/62eaf508705681803e580be5fe4552/Final-Train.png", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/50/edb5a49f0b862b982b945e54e4406e/Final-Train.png", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/3d/2829770e40c961a1b3b7c7e7fbbae0/Final-Train.png", "video": "tOEudSv6PtY", "university-ids": ["minnesota"], "id": 381, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "UMNews", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f2/c0c3766390def44d6704f82d4d7955/favicon.ico", "website_facebook": "UofMN", "id": 50, "logo": "", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Minneapolis", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 44.983334, "location": "Minneapolis, MN, USA", "primary_color": "#7A0019", "abbr_name": "Minnesota", "website": "http://www.umn.edu/", "description": "The University of Minnesota is among the largest public research universities in the country, offering undergraduate, graduate, and professional students a multitude of opportunities for study and research.

If you want to join in any conversation about clinical matters, you need to understand abbreviations and acronyms</li>\n</ul><b>Question: Why can\u2019t I just ask for clarification when someone uses an abbreviation or an acronym?</b>\n\n<br>\n<ul>\n    <li><b><i>Response:</i></b> Clinical settings in American hospitals and clinics are often very busy, noisy, places with people hurrying about to meet patients\u2019 needs. There will be little time for explanation of the meanings of terms. The more emergent the situation, the more likely abbreviations and acronyms will be used. You will be expected to know common abbreviations and acronyms and react appropriately. It would be unsafe to guess at the meaning of what someone is telling you. </li>\n</ul><b>Question: Will I learn all the medical or nursing abbreviations and acronyms?</b>\n\n<br>\n<ul>\n    <li><b><i>Response:</i></b> No. This is a course for beginning students. A major advantage is that the course focuses on only those terms that are common and that you are likely to hear during your early clinical training. We aim to increase your awareness of the situations in which you will hear the new term or abbreviation, safety precautions, and building your confidence as a member of the health care team. </li>\n</ul>\n<b>Question: How will this course help me in my healthcare studies and clinical practice? </b>\n<br>\n<ul>\n   <li><i><b>Response:</b></i> This course emphasizes learning to recognize and interpret common spoken and written clinical terms, abbreviations and acronyms. The recognition and interpretation of these elements of clinical language are essential to communicating with patients and with other health care providers. Understanding and learning this language will help you to function more effectively as a healthcare team member. </li>\n</ul>\n<b>Question: Will I be able to interact with other students taking this course? </b>\n<br>\n<ul>\n    <li><i><b>Response:</b></i>Yes.

{"about_the_course": "<p>Discourse on war and peace has gone through a remarkable transition during\n    the two decades after the end of the Cold War. We do not have to worry\n    of major nuclear wars, and then, no longer can we anticipate stability\n    based on nuclear deterrence. We have no immediate threat emanating from\n    a belligerent adversary equipped with a major arsenal, but we observe a\n    number of small to medium military powers that are more belligerent than\n    the days of the Soviet Union. We have more democracies in the world, and\n    yet are far from the democratic peace that has been imagined by the students\n    of international relations.</p>\n<p>This course aims to nail down some of the basic issues that had been argued\n    in the current research on peace and security. The questions are all deceptively\n    simple enough, but then the answers will all be ambiguous at best. It is\n    my hope that you will be able to provide better answers than those given\n    in the course by developing your own analytical capacity.</p>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f6/5c6c702b2d58350c8166e654e76fe5/warandpeace_image.jpg", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/aa/5fe6a7ced4076a09e05e11490e041b/warandpeace_image.jpg", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/5b/e2cb4790128c5b69ac7b84f407f21d/warandpeace_image.jpg", "video": "", "university-ids": ["todai"], "id": 482, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "", "favicon": "", "website_facebook": "Todai.News.en", "id": 76, "logo": "", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "", "location_country": "JP", "location_lat": 35.6894875, "location": "Tokyo, Japan", "primary_color": "#000080", "abbr_name": "Todai", "website": "http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/", "description": "The University of Tokyo, also known as \"Todai,\" was established in 1877 as the first national university in Japan.

{"about_the_course": "<p>I am pleased to be able to offer free over the Internet a course on Automata Theory, based on the material I have taught periodically at Stanford in the course CS154. Students have access to screencast lecture videos, are given quiz questions, assignments and exams, receive regular feedback on progress, and can participate in a discussion forum. Those who successfully complete the course will receive a statement of accomplishment. You will need a decent Internet connection for accessing course materials, but should be able to watch the videos on your smartphone.</p>\nThe course covers four broad areas: (1) Finite automata and regular expressions, (2) Context-free grammars, (3) Turing machines and decidability, and (4) the theory of intractability, or NP-complete problems.<br><strong><br>Why Study Automata Theory?</strong><br><br>This subject is not just for those planning to enter the field of complexity theory, although it is a good place to start if that is your goal. Rather, the course will emphasize those aspects of the theory that people really use in practice. Finite automata, regular expressions, and context-free grammars are ideas that have stood the test of time. They are essential tools for compilers. But more importantly, they are used in many systems that require input that is less general than a full programming language yet more complex than \"push this button.\"<br><br>The concepts of undecidable problems and intractable problems serve a different purpose. Undecidable problems are those for which no computer solution can ever exist, while intractable problems are those for which there is strong evidence that, although they can be solved by a computer, they cannot be solved sufficiently fast that the solution is truly useful in practice. Understanding this theory, and in particular being able to prove that a problem you are facing belongs to one of these classes, allows you to justify taking another approach \u2014 simplifying the problem or writing code to approximate the solution, for example.<br><br>During the course, I'm going to prove a number of things. The purpose of these proofs is not to torture you or confuse you. Neither are the proofs there because I doubt you would believe me were I merely to state some well-known fact. Rather, understanding how these proofs, especially inductive proofs, work, lets you think more clearly about your own work. I do not advocate proofs that programs are correct, but whenever you attempt something a bit complex, it is good to have in mind the inductive proofs that would be needed to guarantee that what you are doing really works in all cases.", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/automata/large-icon.png", "preview_link": "https://class.coursera.org/automata/lecture/preview", "small_icon_hover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/automata/small-icon.hover.png", "large_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/automata/large-icon.png", "video": "Tb_2HdsqypI", "university-ids": ["stanford"], "id": 14, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/581cda352d067023dcdcc0d9efd36e/favicon-stanford.ico", "website_facebook": "", "id": 1, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d8/4c69670e0826e42c6cd80b4a02b9a2/stanford.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Palo Alto", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 37.4418834, "location": "Palo Alto, CA, United States", "primary_color": "#8c1515", "abbr_name": "Stanford", "website": "", "description": "The Leland Stanford Junior University, commonly referred to as Stanford University or Stanford, is an American private research university located in Stanford, California on an 8,180-acre (3,310 ha) campus near Palo Alto, California, United States.", "short_name": "stanford", "location_state": "CA", "website_youtube": "", "banner": "", "landing_page_banner": "", "name": "Stanford University", "square_logo": "", "square_logo_source": null, "display": true, "location_lng": -122.14301949999998, "home_link": "http://online.stanford.edu/", "class_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/21/9a0294e2bf773901afbfcb5ef47d97/Stanford_Coursera-200x48_RedText_BG.png", "square_logo_svg": null}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "", "course_syllabus": "", "description": "", "short_name": "automata", "target_audience": 1, "faq": "<ul>\n<li><strong>Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?</strong>\n<p>Yes.

First, the entrepreneur\u2019s\n    role will evolve from primarily being a \u201cdoer\u201d to a manager then to a leader\n    and ultimately to being a coach/mentor. Additionally the entrepreneur in\n    most cases moves from being a specialist to a generalist to ultimately\n    being a \u201cconductor\u201d. We will learn from Barbara Lynch, a much-heralded\n    Chef who, with little formal education or training, built a multi-concept\n    restaurant \u201cempire\u201d in Boston, and from Ryan Dienst, one of the founders\n    of Global Medical Imaging.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><strong>Week 2: The \u201cSecret\u201d of High Performance is High Employee Engagement.</strong> Using\n    the Leaders Bank and Trilogy Health Services stories we will look at how\n    two businesses put in place people policies, practices, and a leadership\n    model that led to high employee engagement, loyalty, and productivity that\n    drove high customer satisfaction. We will also focus on the principles\n    of people-centric leadership. During this Week, you will engage with Community\n    members in Workshop learning.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><strong>Week 3: Growth Is Much More Than a Strategy\u2014It Requires a SYSTEM.</strong> Growth\n    is behavioral. To enable and promote the desired behaviors, entrepreneurs\n    have to create an internal aligned system that links, in a consistent self-reinforcing\n    manner, strategy/business model, culture, structure, leadership behaviors,\n    measurements, and rewards. This week we will learn from John Gabbert, who\n    built highly successful retail home furnishings chain Room &amp; Board\n    his way, rejecting the common business practices of his industry. My MBA\n    students find this story mindboggling. If you have work experience, you\n    will also use the Growth System Assessment Tool.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><strong>Week 4: The Surprising Difficulties in Building a Senior Management Team.</strong> &nbsp;I\n    was surprised in my research at how difficult it was for entrepreneur\u2019s\n    to build a senior management team. In many cases it took multiple hirings\n    to get the right fit. And even then, getting the senior management team\n    to \u201cplay well together\u201d was challenging. Lastly, most entrepreneurs were\n    not prepared for the need to \u201cupgrade\u201d their management team as the business\n    grew.

{"about_the_course": "We live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena. We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one.\nWhy do models make us better thinkers?\nModels help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life.\nHere's how the course will work.\nFor each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a certificate of completion. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that's fine too. It's all free. And it's all here to help make you a better thinker!", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/modelthinking/large-icon.png", "preview_link": "https://class.coursera.org/modelthinking//lecture/preview", "small_icon_hover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/modelthinking/small-icon.hover.png", "large_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/modelthinking/large-icon.png", "video": "RX5LBZvEh10", "university-ids": ["umich"], "id": 11, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "umich", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/50/52265d555e7bf0b0b86f7a1a07a183/favicon-umich.ico", "website_facebook": "universityofmichigan", "id": 3, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/99/263203c94842c44bcf757c4a801e8f/U-M_LogoSmHoriz_160x60.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Ann Arbor", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 42.2808256, "location": "Ann Arbor, MI", "primary_color": "#002e5f", "abbr_name": "Michigan", "website": "http://www.umich.edu/", "description": "The University of Michigan is a public research university located in Ann Arbor, Michigan in the United States.", "short_name": "umich", "location_state": "MI", "website_youtube": "user/um", "banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/36/1d953d8380a15d8eb0d307c7cde0bb/banner-umich.jpg", "landing_page_banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/03/70c6a457583d267a869cb6555b4de5/DIL-17Apr12_AT150a_EDIT_TO_2.jpg", "name": "University of Michigan", "square_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/70/de505d47be7d3a063b51b6f856a6e2/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_600x600.png", "square_logo_source": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/26/23ecbedd1043250eab7d1b0a41696b/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_600x600.png", "display": true, "location_lng": -83.74303780000002, "home_link": null, "class_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/05/1a1f4b975bf71dba0ac79042ed651e/U-M_LogoSmHoriz_200x48.png", "square_logo_svg": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/6b/fce84d27ebcd493f839f14df253541/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_.svg"}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "", "course_syllabus": "", "description": "", "short_name": "modelthinking", "target_audience": null, "faq": "<ul>\n<li><strong>Do I need to buy a textbook?</strong>\n<p>No. I'm working to get all necessary reading material to be available for free on the course web site.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Will I get a certificate after completing this class?</strong>\n<p>Yes.

{"about_the_course": "Behavioral economics and the closely related field of behavioral finance couple scientific research on the psychology of decision making with economic theory to better understand what motivates investors, employees, and consumers. This course will be based heavily on my own research. We will examine topics such as how emotion rather than cognition determines economic decisions, \u201cirrational\u201d patterns of thinking about money and investments, how expectations shape perceptions, economic and psychological analyses of dishonesty by presumably honest people, and how social and financial incentives combine to motivate labor by everyday workers and CEOs alike. This highly interdisciplinary course will be relevant to all human beings. <br><br>This class has two main goals:<ol>\n<li>To introduce you to the range of cases where people (consumers, investors, managers, and significant others) make decisions that are inconsistent with standard economic theory and the assumptions of rational decision making. This is the lens of behavioral economics.</li>\n<li>To help you think creatively about the applications of behavioral economic principles for the development of new products, technology based products, public policies, and to understand how business and social policy strategies could be modified with a deeper understanding of the effects these principles have on employees and customers.</li>\n</ol>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/behavioralecon/large-icon.png", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/behavioralecon/small-icon.hover.png", "large_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/behavioralecon/large-icon.png", "video": "dzSfmkbQClk", "university-ids": ["duke"], "id": 123, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/65/b1eae360095757f04b8bfda5fdbb62/Duke_University_Logo.svg", "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "DukeNews", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cc/500c9f41731d797a0e108a4edd8bc1/favicon-duke.ico", "website_facebook": "DukeUniv", "id": 7, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/67/20d9fca42bddac2034668d7b589cad/dukewidelogo_vert.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Durham", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 35.9940329, "location": "Durham, NC, USA", "primary_color": "#003366", "abbr_name": "Duke", "website": "http://duke.edu/", "description": "Home of the Blue Devils, Duke University has about 13,000 undergraduate and graduate students and a world-class faculty helping to expand the frontiers of knowledge.

{"about_the_course": "<div>When a 3-dimensional world is projected onto a 2-dimensional image, such as the human retina or a photograph, reconstructing back the layout and contents of the real-world becomes an ill-posed problem that is extremely difficult to solve. Humans possess the remarkable ability to navigate and understand the visual world by solving the inversion problem going from 2D to 3D. Computer Vision, a modern discipline of artificial intelligence, seeks to imitate such abilities of humans to recognize objects, navigate scenes, reconstruct layouts, and understand the geometric space and semantic meaning of the visual world. These abilities are critical in many applications including personal robotics, autonomous driving and exploration as well as photo organization, image or video retrieval and human-computer interaction.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>This course delivers a systematic overview of computer vision, comparable to an advanced graduate level class. We emphasize on two key issues in modeling vision: space and meaning. We begin by laying out the main problems vision needs to solve: mapping out the 3D structure of objects and scenes, recognizing objects, segmenting objects, recognizing meaning of scenes, understanding movements of humans, etc. Motivated by these important problems centered on the understanding of space and meaning, we will study the fundamental theories and important algorithms of computer vision together, starting from the analysis of 2D images, and culminating in the holistic understanding of a 3D scene</div>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/computervision/large-icon.png", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/computervision/small-icon.hover.png", "large_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/computervision/large-icon.png", "video": "8qLMDGQ02eI", "university-ids": ["stanford", "umich"], "id": 43, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/581cda352d067023dcdcc0d9efd36e/favicon-stanford.ico", "website_facebook": "", "id": 1, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d8/4c69670e0826e42c6cd80b4a02b9a2/stanford.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Palo Alto", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 37.4418834, "location": "Palo Alto, CA, United States", "primary_color": "#8c1515", "abbr_name": "Stanford", "website": "", "description": "The Leland Stanford Junior University, commonly referred to as Stanford University or Stanford, is an American private research university located in Stanford, California on an 8,180-acre (3,310 ha) campus near Palo Alto, California, United States.", "short_name": "stanford", "location_state": "CA", "website_youtube": "", "banner": "", "landing_page_banner": "", "name": "Stanford University", "square_logo": "", "square_logo_source": null, "display": true, "location_lng": -122.14301949999998, "home_link": "http://online.stanford.edu/", "class_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/21/9a0294e2bf773901afbfcb5ef47d97/Stanford_Coursera-200x48_RedText_BG.png", "square_logo_svg": null}, {"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "umich", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/50/52265d555e7bf0b0b86f7a1a07a183/favicon-umich.ico", "website_facebook": "universityofmichigan", "id": 3, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/99/263203c94842c44bcf757c4a801e8f/U-M_LogoSmHoriz_160x60.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Ann Arbor", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 42.2808256, "location": "Ann Arbor, MI", "primary_color": "#002e5f", "abbr_name": "Michigan", "website": "http://www.umich.edu/", "description": "The University of Michigan is a public research university located in Ann Arbor, Michigan in the United States.", "short_name": "umich", "location_state": "MI", "website_youtube": "user/um", "banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/36/1d953d8380a15d8eb0d307c7cde0bb/banner-umich.jpg", "landing_page_banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/03/70c6a457583d267a869cb6555b4de5/DIL-17Apr12_AT150a_EDIT_TO_2.jpg", "name": "University of Michigan", "square_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/70/de505d47be7d3a063b51b6f856a6e2/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_600x600.png", "square_logo_source": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/26/23ecbedd1043250eab7d1b0a41696b/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_600x600.png", "display": true, "location_lng": -83.74303780000002, "home_link": null, "class_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/05/1a1f4b975bf71dba0ac79042ed651e/U-M_LogoSmHoriz_200x48.png", "square_logo_svg": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/6b/fce84d27ebcd493f839f14df253541/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_.svg"}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "", "course_syllabus": "<div>Part 0: Introduction -

{"about_the_course": "One of the most interesting\nand important developments in social science since 1970 has been the\n\"discovery\" of a consistent economic logic underlying the great\ncommon law subjects of property, contract, tort and crime, the\nthousand-year-old bedrock of the English and American legal systems. Property\nand contract provide the institutional\nscaffolding that makes free exchange in markets possible, while the liability\nsystems of tort and crime appear to&nbsp;mimic market exchange in areas of human activity\nwhere free exchange itself, for well-defined reasons, is not possible. This\ncourse seeks to expose this underlying economic logic through the close\ninvestigation of a series of paradigmatic problems and examples in light of\nsome simple but very powerful economic ideas. The course assumes no prior\nbackground in economics or law, and begins with an introduction to the basic\nconcepts of property, exchange, efficiency and externality. On this foundation,\nspecific topics in the law, including property, tort&nbsp;and crime, eminent domain, intellectual property and criminal procedure,&nbsp;are considered. Each group of lectures will\nelaborate on a different concrete problem or example to suggest the range of legal issues and questions&nbsp;to which economic reasoning can be productively applied. The ideas and\nmodes of analysis developed in the course are not difficult or mysterious, but\nthe questions of interpretation and policy that they raise about a subject&nbsp;that affects everyone&nbsp;are challenging and\nprovocative. <p></p>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/20/29a56e9044b4ed07a9abc3140b84bf/Smokestacks_3958.jpeg", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/69/5a79fb00587dbeadb42b6dc7671ead/Smokestacks_3958.jpg", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/fc/5a1e6df000135e39d0ea2231d2ce74/Smokestacks_3958.jpg", "video": "UzJNfaoki2c", "university-ids": ["wesleyan"], "id": 221, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": "", "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "wesleyan_u", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/03/3d1139223689f57de761dd6783d8c3/6-wesleyan_small_icon.gif", "website_facebook": "wesleyan.university", "id": 34, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/e6/00d8a35e2324a3a5448474f800cbc4/1-wesleyan_logo.gif", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Middletown", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 41.5623209, "location": "Middletown, CT, United States", "primary_color": "#990000", "abbr_name": "Wesleyan", "website": "http://www.wesleyan.edu/", "description": "Wesleyan University is known for the excellence of its academic and co-curricular programs.

This one is essentially a programming course that concentrates on developing code; that one is essentially a math course that concentrates on understanding proofs. This course is about learning algorithms in the context of implementing and testing them in practical applications; that one is about learning algorithms in the context of developing mathematical models that help explain why they are efficient.

However, we require that you submit the programming assignments in Java.

{"about_the_course": "<span>\n <span><span>\n  <span>\n  <p>This\n  course introduces software defined networking, an emerging paradigm in\n  computer networking that allows a logically centralized software program to\n  control the behavior of an entire network. &nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Separating\n  a network's control logic from the underlying physical routers and switches\n  that forward traffic allows network operators to write high-level control\n  programs that specify the behavior of an entire network, in contrast to\n  conventional networks, whereby network operators must codify functionality in\n  terms of low-level device configuration. &nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Logically\n  centralized network control makes it possible for operators to specify more\n  complex tasks that involve integrating many disjoint network functions (e.g.,\n  security, resource control, prioritization) into a single control framework,\n  allowing network operators to create more sophisticated policies, and making\n  network configurations easier to configure, manage, troubleshoot, and\n  debug.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  </span>\n </span>\n</span></span>", "other_description": "", "photo":

{"about_the_course": "Over two thousand years ago, the ancient Greeks wondered if other worlds were habitable. In the coming years this question will be experimentally tested. This course, offered by the UK Centre for Astrobiology at the University of Edinburgh,&nbsp;is an introduction to astrobiology. It explores the origin and evolution of life on the Earth and its potential to exist elsewhere. Astrobiology addresses compelling questions of wide interest such as: How did life originate on the Earth? Is this an inevitable process and is life common across the Universe? Astrobiology is an interdisciplinary science that bridges fields as diverse as astrophysics, biology, geosciences and chemistry. <br><br> In this course we will explore what we know about life\u2019s ability to live in extreme environments on the Earth, we will look at different hypotheses for how it originated. We will look at some of the missions to search for life in our own Solar System and on planets orbiting distant stars. We will discuss some of the extreme environments on the Earth that help us understand the limits of life and how life has adapted to cope with extremes. We will explore the possibility of intelligent alien life and some of the implications of its detection.

You might have lots of time and interest,\n        and so are ready to invest deeply in this course; or you might have many\n        life commitments that leave you with less time, but still want to learn\n        many of the concepts that this course will offer. We want to make our class\n        useful for YOU -- whatever your life and interests lead you to right now\n        -- and so we are creating three kinds of student profiles, called Adventurers,\n        Explorers, and Tourists.</p>\n    <p><i>Adventurers</i>. You have signed up for the class and are serious about\n        mastering the entire course. You are committed to doing the course-related\n        quizzes, activities, and assignments, AND you are eager and able to complete\n        a course-long project, either alone or as part of a team. As an Adventurer,\n        you want to take full advantage of this great opportunity to build on your\n        creative potential and create something innovative that will change your\n        life or the lives of those around you for the better!</p>\n    <p><i>Explorers</i>. You are eager to learn and contribute to the course,\n        but your available time allows you to participate only in the class assignments\n        (weekly quizzes and activities), not in project work. You are excited about\n        the material and play an active role in the course, perhaps by providing\n        feedback and mentoring other students, just as Adventurers and Tourists\n        can do at any time. We need the contributions of everyone in the community!</p><span><i>Tourists</i>. You have signed up for the class, love it, want to take it, but because of other commitments in life, you cannot commit to the course all the time. This is fine! As a Tourist, you come and go to the course platform, watch some of the videos now and then, participate in some activities here and there, and do your best to stick with the class from the beginning to the end , trying to get as much as you can out of it.

{"about_the_course": "With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, <b></b>dedication, and creativity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.&nbsp; Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. <br><br>We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),&nbsp; a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. <br><br>After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board\u2014a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.<br>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/01/ddf467a93b09155ddb4f07b07204b1/production-large.jpg", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c4/c514758cc151d86f66c9b853ec52aa/production-large.jpg", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/fe/015ba2a0d465c31b47ac36670098ea/production-large.jpg", "video": "pgIQ7ouOw4M", "university-ids": ["berklee"], "id": 222, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/10/bb37f439a00f92524143611e504b27/favicon.png", "website_facebook": "", "id": 21, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c4/885ec60036341f549253081e8784d1/berklee_logo.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "", "location_country": "", "location_lat": null, "location": "", "primary_color": "#0088CC", "abbr_name": "Berkleemusic", "website": "", "description": "", "short_name": "berklee", "location_state": "", "website_youtube": "", "banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ce/77a045e73e76620497bd0992177021/masthead.jpg", "landing_page_banner": "", "name": "Berklee College of Music", "square_logo": "", "square_logo_source": "", "display": true, "location_lng": null, "home_link": null, "class_logo": "", "square_logo_svg": ""}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "", "course_syllabus": "<b>Lesson 1: Recording Signal Flow</b><br><blockquote>Sound, Microphones, Cables, Microphone Preamp, A to D Converter, DAW, DSP, D to A converter, Amplifier, Speakers (path of speaker is same as waveshape in DAW)<br></blockquote><b>Lesson 2: DAW (Editing)</b><br><blockquote>Multitrack Concept, Audio vs. MIDI, Regions and Sound Files, File Management, Grid, Trim, Cut, Paste, Crossfade, Automate, Software Instruments, MIDI Editing, Bounce<br></blockquote><b>Lesson 3: Mixer (Summing)</b><br><blockquote>Adding Waveforms, Mute and Solo, Stereo and Mono, Panning, Busses, Submix, Insert, Categories of Effects, Sends, Pre/Post Sends, Aux Tracks/Returns<br></blockquote><b>Lesson 4: Dynamics Processing</b><br><blockquote>Dynamic Range, Distortion and Noise, Volume Automation, Envelope (RMS), Dynamic Processors, Attack and Release, Conceptual Downward Expander and Gate, Conceptual Compressor and Limiter, Practical Gate, Practical Compressor<br></blockquote><b>Lesson 5: Delay and Filters</b> <br><blockquote>Conceptual Delay, Delay Spectrum, Filters, Equalization, Short Delay (Comb Filter), Short Modulated Delay (Flanger), Long Delay (Synchronized), Reverb, Depth in Mixing<br></blockquote><b>Lesson 6: Synthesizer</b><br><blockquote>Synthesizer and Sampler, Synthesizer Overview, Oscillator, Filter, Amplifier, Modulation, Envelope, LFO,&nbsp; A Language of Timbre<br></blockquote>", "description": "", "short_name": "musicproduction", "target_audience": 3, "faq": "<ul><li>Do I need any special software for this course?</li></ul><blockquote>To get the most out of this course, you should have a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) installed on your computer.

{"about_the_course": "The comic book pamphlet developed as an independent literary form in the 1930s and early 1940s and has been a favorite of adolescent enthusiasts and cult devotees ever since. Recently, it has entered into a process of transformation, moving from a species of pulp fiction on the margins of children\u2019s literature to an autonomous genre, one Will Eisner labeled the graphic novel. This transformation has been noted in such literary venues as the New York Times and the New Yorker, as well as in an increasing number of university classrooms and bookstore shelves. <br><br>\u201cComic books and Graphic Novels\u201d presents a survey of the history of American comics and a review of major graphic novels circulating in the U.

{"about_the_course": "<p>Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.</p>\n<p>This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.</p>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/ml/large-icon.png", "preview_link": "https://class.coursera.org/ml/lecture/preview", "small_icon_hover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/ml/small-icon.hover.png", "large_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/ml/large-icon.png", "video": "e0WKJLovaZg", "university-ids": ["stanford"], "id": 2, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/581cda352d067023dcdcc0d9efd36e/favicon-stanford.ico", "website_facebook": "", "id": 1, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d8/4c69670e0826e42c6cd80b4a02b9a2/stanford.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Palo Alto", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 37.4418834, "location": "Palo Alto, CA, United States", "primary_color": "#8c1515", "abbr_name": "Stanford", "website": "", "description": "The Leland Stanford Junior University, commonly referred to as Stanford University or Stanford, is an American private research university located in Stanford, California on an 8,180-acre (3,310 ha) campus near Palo Alto, California, United States.", "short_name": "stanford", "location_state": "CA", "website_youtube": "", "banner": "", "landing_page_banner": "", "name": "Stanford University", "square_logo": "", "square_logo_source": null, "display": true, "location_lng": -122.14301949999998, "home_link": "http://online.stanford.edu/", "class_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/21/9a0294e2bf773901afbfcb5ef47d97/Stanford_Coursera-200x48_RedText_BG.png", "square_logo_svg": null}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "", "course_syllabus": "", "description": "", "short_name": "ml", "target_audience": 1, "faq": "<div class=\"coursera-course-faq\">\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What is the format of the class?</strong>\n<p>The class will consist of lecture videos, which are broken into small chunks, usually between eight and twelve minutes each.

As in gardening, you cannot make these ideas grow: you have to plant them with care and let them grow.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>What is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class?</strong>\n<p>How a battery can be in salt water for 100 years, used over and over, and yet never discharge.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>", "category-ids": ["biology", "physics"], "visibility": 0, "short_description": "Nerves, the heart, and the brain are electrical.

This work formed the basis for the solution of problems in field stimulation, threshold variability, and defibrillation mechanisms. &nbsp;Together they also wrote the text Bioelectricity, A Quantitative Approach 3E (Springer). &nbsp;In 2008 Professor Barr received the IEEE-Engineering in Medicine and Biology Career Achievement Award, that organization\u2019s highest honor.", "small_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/bioelectricity/small-icon.hover.png", "course-ids": [216, 970426, 970737], "display": true, "recommended_background": "<p>Insofar as\nBioelectricity, this course begins at the beginning, so all the main ideas can\nbe understood without prerequisite courses. &nbsp;As electricity is invisible,\nno one sees it, so the most important prerequisite is one\u2019s willingness to\nbring imagination, reflection and patience to the topics, so as to allow the\nideas to grow and knit together in one\u2019s own mind. </p>\n\n<p>Some of the\npresentation uses equations and other mathematics that come from calculus and\ndifferential equations and other parts reason from the physics of electricity\nand the analysis of circuits, so background knowledge about these subjects is\nhelpful.

The\nslides are designed to help you visualize the motivations for --and\nchallenges of-- concurrent and networked software.  We also\nsummarize how patterns and frameworks help address key challenges of\nconcurrent and networked software.</li>\n<li><p><strong>Section 1: Introduction to concurrency and networking</strong> (3.5 hours), which provides\nbackground info pertaining largely to the OS and middleware layers.\nWe discuss key design dimensions of concurrent and networked\nsoftware, as well as review common operating system programming\nmechanisms and Android programming mechanisms.  This part focuses on\nconcepts and is generally independent of programming language.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Section 2: Overview of patterns and frameworks</strong> (6 hours), which focuses on\npattern-oriented software architecture, with an emphasis on\nconcurrent and networked software.  We explore key pattern and\nframework concepts, relationships, and examples, as well as evaluate\nthe pros and cons of patterns and frameworks.  Small code examples\nare shown throughout using C++ and Java, though this section\nconcentrates more on design rather than programming.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Section 3: Applying patterns and frameworks to develop concurrent and\nnetworked software</strong> (6 hours), which examines lots of code.  An open-source web\nserver is used as a running example to illustrate patterns and\nframeworks pertaining to service access, communication, synchronous\nevent handling, connection establishment, service initialization,\nservice configuration and activation, concurrency and\nsynchronization, and asynchronous event handling.  The bulk of the\nexamples are in C++, along with some Java examples to demonstrate the\ngenerality of patterns and frameworks.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Appendix: Presents a case study that applies many \"Gang of Four\"\npatterns</strong> (3.5 hours) that aren't directly related to concurrent and networked\nsoftware.  It evaluates the limitations with algorithm design and shows\nhow pattern-oriented design alleviates these limitations.  The\nexamples are largely in C++, again with some Java examples to show\nhow pattern-oriented design simplifies portability across programming\nlanguages.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The PDF and PowerPoint versions of all the slides used in the course will be available online as the videos become available on the course website.

At GNF, he worked on the assembly of the complete mammalian transcriptomes (Hogenesch et al., Cell, 2001), as well as on the mRNA characterization of their expression (Su et al, PNAS 2002; Su et al., PNAS, 2004). Current interests include the development of genome wide methodologies for the study of cellular pathways using cDNAs and siRNAs (Conkright et al., Molecular Cell, 2003; Sato et al, Neuron, 2004 ; Willingham et al., Science, 2005; Sato et al., Nature Genetics, 2006). In 2006, Dr. Hogenesch joined the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. He is now Professor of Pharmacology, Director of the Penn Center for Bioinformatics, and Associate Director of the Penn Genome Frontiers Institute.\n<p><img width=\"150\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/genomescience/instructor-2.jpg\" height=\"203\" style=\"width: 200px;\" class=\"coursera-instructor-thumb\"> </p><p><a href=\"http://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8377794\">John Isaac Murray</a> did his graduate work in Genetics with David Botstein at Stanford University. He worked on several projects, including the genome-wide characterization of stress responsive and cell cycle regulated genes in human cells, and in defining gene expression signatures of the autoimmune disease Scleroderma. His work on stress responses identified highly distinct gene expression responses to different types of stress in a single cell type, and to the same stress in different cell types. To extend this type of expression analysis to an in vivo setting, he joined the laboratory of Robert Waterston in the University of Washington department of Genome Sciences. There, he developed automated microscopy based methods to allow the single-cell resolution measurement of gene expression in developing embryos of the nematode C. elegans, a major model organism. Applying these methods to define expression patterns at high resolution for a large collection of transcription factors identified novel mechanisms and important regulators of developmental fate specification, which Dr. Murray is now studying in his own laboratory. Since 2010 he has been Assistant Professor of Genetics at the Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania and a core member of the Penn Genome Frontiers Institute.</p>", "small_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/genomescience/small-icon.hover.png", "course-ids": [138, 970486], "display": true, "recommended_background": ""}

The empiricist position holds that very little, if any, of language\ndepends on innate abilities and its acquisition can be accounted for by typical\nperceptual and cognitive processes. To evaluate these two theoretical\nframeworks, we will learn about language structure, how it is used, and how it\nis acquired.</p>\n\n<p><b>Lectures 3 and 4: </b>To set the stage for assessing the\npossibility of naturally acquired reading, we will explore speech perception\nand how it is acquired. Speech has also had two alternative theoretical\nframeworks, and we will consider relevant research that addresses their\ndifferences. The goal of this assessment is to better understand what is\nrequired for speech perception and its acquisition and how these requirements\ncompare to the natural acquisition of reading.</p>\n\n<p><b>Lectures 5 and 6: </b>These lectures will give an overview of\nresearch and theory on reading and literacy. Given the possibility of naturally\nacquired reading, we will review the nature of reading and how it is currently\ntaught. One of the main goals is to destroy prevalent myths about how we read.\nThis discussion will highlight the assumptions in current practice and how they\ncompare to the possibility of naturally acquired reading.</p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 7: </b>As covered in the previous lectures, it is\ncommonly believed that spoken and signed languages are acquired from birth\nonward by natural interactions with persons who talk whereas learning to read\nrequires formal instruction and schooling. We consider the hypothesis that once\nan appropriate form of written text is made available early in a child\u2019s life\nbefore formal schooling begins, reading will also be learned inductively,\nemerge naturally, and with no significant negative consequences. We will\nexamine the role of perception and action modalities in language acquisition\nand use and compare spoken and signed languages to written languages.</p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 8: </b>We will describe the demographics of literacy and\nilliteracy and their social and economic implications. The cost of illiteracy\nas well as the huge cost of formal literacy instruction is one of the major\nfinancial burdens on societies.</p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 9: </b>We will study the implications of naturally\nacquired literacy for individuals who are spoken and/or written language\nchallenged because of deafness or other impairments.</p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 10. </b>We will review past technological developments\nto set the stage for peering into the future. We will discuss the various technologies\navailable or soon to be available that will allow growing children to\nexperience an augmented reality that will be capable of supplementing their\nreal world experience with various forms of language generated automatically.</p>", "description": "", "short_name": "childliteracy", "target_audience": 0, "faq": "<ul><li><strong>Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?</strong>\n<p>Yes.

{"about_the_course": "<div>Design thinking is a popular new idea in the business world. Accelerated by the spectacular rise of Apple and IDEO, design thinking offers an approach better suited for dealing with the accelerating pressures for growth and innovation faced by so many firms and their managers today than business\u2019 traditional analytic methods. But design thinking can remain mysterious for business students and managers interested in introducing this approach into their decision-making processes. Demystifying it is the focus of this course.</div><div>Though designing as a craft requires years of dedicated education and talent to master, design thinking, as a problem solving approach, does not. In this course, we work with the following model that contains four questions and ten tools:<br><img src=\"https://coursera-topic-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/27/12e27d2216ba70fd7089556c788733/design_business.jpg\"><br>&nbsp;<br></div><div>The four sequential questions that take us on a journey through an assessment of current reality (What is?), the envisioning of a new future (What if?), the development of some concepts for new-business opportunities (What wows?), and the testing of some of those in the marketplace (What works?). The process of design thinking begins with data gathering: at the outset of the design process, designers gather a great deal of data on the users they want to create value for. &nbsp;They mostly do this through ethnographic methods like experience mapping, rather than traditional methods like focus groups and surveys. Farther along in the process, designers make their new ideas concrete (in the form of prototypes) and go out and get better data from the real world in a process that is hypothesis-driven. That is, they treat their new ideas as hypotheses to be tested. They surface the assumptions underlying their hypotheses and test them \u2013 usually looking for the kind of behavioral metrics that will allow them to iterate their way to improved value propositions.&nbsp;</div><div>Accompanying the four questions is a set of new tools to help business people achieve the same kind of disciplined approach to innovation and growth that they bring to the rest of their business.</div>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/99/bba417ab75418d0ea4ffe4e59307ba/DatD_Coursera.png", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f8/0fda7e21538899bc3f48391f72f1d2/DatD_Coursera.png", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/5b/e90b07f9b99d0b23f23d9c949ad68d/DatD_Coursera.png", "video": "UHpQXC8rPfg", "university-ids": ["uva"], "id": 436, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ba/8cf6b18a752fa9ba66be05d904571d/favicon-uva.ico", "website_facebook": "", "id": 18, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d4/a193b107772ef0132965d063f454f5/uvalogo-coursera.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Charlottesville", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 38.0293059, "location": "Charlottesville, VA", "primary_color": "#212659", "abbr_name": "Virginia", "website": "", "description": "", "short_name": "uva", "location_state": "VA", "website_youtube": "", "banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d0/60eab4b04a9acfbbaf95f829cae2f0/banner-uva.jpg", "landing_page_banner": "", "name": "University of Virginia", "square_logo": "", "square_logo_source": null, "display": true, "location_lng": -78.47667810000002, "home_link": null, "class_logo": "", "square_logo_svg": null}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "", "course_syllabus": "<div><b>Week 1: What is Design Thinking?</b> We will begin our course by unpacking what we mean by design thinking and why it is more effective than traditional business methods when the goal is innovation in the business environment. &nbsp;By looking at the case histories of a set of successful growth leaders, we will explore how their mindsets and practices enabled them to achieve innovation and growth.

This week we will look at some of the design tools used to accomplish this. As part of assessing What is? for instance, designers \u201cfollow the customer home\u201d and explore their problems in life versus their use of his product, using an ethnographic technique called \u201cjourney mapping.\u201d We will also look at tools like visualization that uses imagery to bring ideas to life and mind mapping that helps us make sense of the data we have collected.</div><div><br><b>Week 3: Exploring Question 2 - What if? &nbsp;</b>Once you have thoroughly explored and looked for patterns in what is, you can look toward the future and ask What if? This question and the tools associated with it will be the focus of week 3. This is the creative part of the process - but it also contains a disciplined approach.

{"about_the_course": "What is image and video processing? Images and videos are everywhere, from those we take with our mobile devices and share with our friends to those that we receive from Mars and the ones we see in the movie theatre, without forgetting the whole ensemble of images of our bodies that are taken in hospital visits. Image and video processing is the art of working with such images and movies, from making it possible to store and transmit them to making those dark and blurry images look nice, as well as interpreting and analyzing the medical data and recognizing our friends\u2019 faces in social pictures. This discipline is also fascinating because it uses tools from many areas of applied mathematics. In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms.<br><br> The course will start with an introduction to the basics of image formation and the fundamental concepts that translate a physical scene into a digital image. We will then describe the underlying concepts of image compression, the enabling technology that makes it possible for images to be sent from Mars and videos to be stored in our mobile phones. We will cover the most fundamental tools in image enhancement, showing how simple tools can significantly improve images. Both geometric and non-geometric tools as well as spatial and non-spatial operations will be presented. Details on image segmentation will be provided, one of the most fundamental and useful problems in image processing. The above topics will be extended to color images and video.

{"about_the_course": "<b></b>In this\ncourse we shall examine how the idea of \"the modern\" develops at the\nend of the 18th century, and how being modern (or progressive, or hip) became\none of the crucial criteria for understanding and evaluating cultural change\nduring the last two hundred years. We shall be concerned with the relations\nbetween culture and historical change, and our materials shall be drawn from a\nvariety of areas: philosophy, the novel, and critical theory. Finally, we shall try to\ndetermine what it means to be modern today, and whether it makes sense to go\nbeyond the modern to the postmodern.\n\n\n\n<p><i>The Modern and the Postmodern</i> traces the intertwining of the\nidea of modernity with the idea of art or culture from the late 18th\ncentury until the present. Beginning with the Enlightenment, Western cultures\nhave invested heavily in the notion that the world can be made more of a home\nfor human beings through the development of culture (and technology).\nThroughout this period there has also developed a strong, sophisticated\ncounter-movement that sees the Enlightenment effort as a disaster \u2013 destructive\nof both art and of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\nWestern idea of modernity is linked to but not the same as the idea of\nmodernism. We will examine both in this class and then consider postmodernism\nin relation both to the philosophical idea of modernity and to the aesthetic\nconsiderations of modernism.</p>\n\n\n\nThis course covers a lot of ground,\nhistorically, conceptually and aesthetically. There is much to read, and very\ndifferent kinds of reading: from philosophy to novels, from theory to poetry.\nNot all students will like all the reading, but if you digest it all, you\nshould have a clearer sense of the cultural history of our present. \n\n\n\n<br><br>Students\nshould develop a historical, literary and philosophical understanding of some\nof the key themes of modernity and modernism in the West. They should learn to\nread classic and contemporary texts for their arguments, beauty and pertinence.\nThey should see why these texts are \u201cgood to think with,\u201d and, it is hoped,\nthey will develop an appetite for further study in the areas covered by the\ncourse.\n<br>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ae/40ab4d371617977d0c8b273d63e014/The-Bar-at-the-Folies-Bergeres-by-Edouard-Manet.jpg", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/40/e01a7194c35f414f37235a1a4a96e9/The-Bar-at-the-Folies-Bergeres-by-Edouard-Manet.jpg", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/e5/cdbf24bfcaacee34eac286619c822b/The-Bar-at-the-Folies-Bergeres-by-Edouard-Manet.jpg", "video": "yA8mAeMib3s", "university-ids": ["wesleyan"], "id": 177, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": "", "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "wesleyan_u", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/03/3d1139223689f57de761dd6783d8c3/6-wesleyan_small_icon.gif", "website_facebook": "wesleyan.university", "id": 34, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/e6/00d8a35e2324a3a5448474f800cbc4/1-wesleyan_logo.gif", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Middletown", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 41.5623209, "location": "Middletown, CT, United States", "primary_color": "#990000", "abbr_name": "Wesleyan", "website": "http://www.wesleyan.edu/", "description": "Wesleyan University is known for the excellence of its academic and co-curricular programs.

{"about_the_course": "It is estimated that 5-8% of school-aged children and 4% of adults in the United States suffer from some form of attention deficit disorder and that the incidence of the disorder is increasing in the population. Although it is the most widely studied behavior disorder of childhood, its etiology remains unclear, its outcome is variable, and its treatment is complex and moderately successful. Advances in neuroscience have provided new insights into the pathophysiology of ADHD, pointing to key neural circuits involved in attention, behavioral control, learning, and reward maintenance that appear to be underperforming in patients with the disorder. Moreover, the etiology of this heterogeneous disorder points to the key role of genetic and&nbsp;environmental interactions during prenatal and perinatal periods. Over the past decade, new diagnostic and interventional approaches have enabled clinicians to better diagnose and treat ADHD across the lifespan, while longitudinal studies have elucidated the long-term impact of the disorder on health and adaptive functioning.<br><br>This course is intended for students with a background in psychology and/or neuroscience who are interested in learning more about the complexities of ADHD from both scientific and clinical perspectives. Scientific topics covered include prevalence and epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, clinical presentation at different ages, impact on development (intellect, academic, speech and language, emotional self control, motivation and executive functioning), health outcomes (risk taking, accidents, injuries, driving difficulties, unintended pregnancy), co-existing conditions (anxiety, mood, substance use disorders), and etiology (genetic, pre/perinatal, neurodevelopmental, neuroanatomic, neuropsychological).

&nbsp;What are the responsibilities of the\n    investigators, sponsors and ethics committees who conduct and oversee these\n    trials?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Along with our colleagues, we will introduce you to how GCP is applied\n    in clinical vaccine trials to ensure proper and ethical scientific conduct.\n    The course will use examples from real vaccine trials to demonstrate the\n    application of the FDA Code of Federal Regulations and ICH GCP Guidelines\n    to explore methods and best practices involved in implementing phase I\n    and II vaccine clinical trials. &nbsp;This short course offering through\n    Coursera is based on our work at the Center for Immunization Research and\n    an in-depth graduate course taught at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School\n    of Public Health.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>We hope it inspires you to work in this exciting field.</div>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/vacctrials/large-icon.png", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/vacctrials/small-icon.hover.png", "large_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/vacctrials/large-icon.png", "video": "7gFTebM2dRU", "university-ids": ["jhu"], "id": 78, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "JohnsHopkins", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/80/d81353ccd0bab30962a5770d7aec97/favicon-jhu.ico", "website_facebook": "johnshopkinsuniversity", "id": 8, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cf/0db65d1501244b9e6eacfa5e637fea/logo-jhu-front.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Baltimore", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 39.2903848, "location": "Baltimore, MD", "primary_color": "#0061AA", "abbr_name": "Johns Hopkins", "website": "http://www.jhu.edu/", "description": "The mission of The Johns Hopkins University is to educate its students and cultivate their capacity for life-long learning, to foster independent and original research, and to bring the benefits of discovery to the world.", "short_name": "jhu", "location_state": "MD", "website_youtube": "johnshopkins", "banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/83/94437b11dcbef874ea1f30d960a26b/banner-jhu.jpg", "landing_page_banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c2/544537cee93c0acd67b6573d46a32e/Coursera-banner.jpg", "name": "Johns Hopkins University", "square_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f6/4798f308d4eaa66fc53e99a92d65e5/JHU_360x360.png", "square_logo_source": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/39/7f8dfbe935fe6b3f1eb2e85e307375/JHU_360x360.png", "display": true, "location_lng": -76.61218930000001, "home_link": null, "class_logo": "", "square_logo_svg": ""}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "http://coursera-course-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/a9/61acb25a805dbaf8da2f498acae5bd/logo-jhu-course.png", "course_syllabus": "This course will cover the following topics: A brief review of vaccine\nhistory and types; how vaccine trials are conducted, including which data\nare collected and how those data are managed and evaluated; appropriate\nprocesses to ensure human subjects protection and informed consent; methods\nfor recruitment and enrollment of participants; and vaccine safety assessment.\nUpon successfully completing this course, students will be able to:\n<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n    <li>Describe the types of vaccines in use today</li>\n    <li>Describe how vaccines are evaluated in phase I and II clinical trials</li>\n    <li>Identify key regulatory requirements, considerations and ethical standards\n        for human subjects protection and informed consent.&nbsp;</li>\n    <li>Discuss how clinical trials are conducted with an emphasis on quality\n        data and protection of the rights, safety and well-being of volunteers.</li>\n</ul>", "description": "", "short_name": "vacctrials", "target_audience": 1, "faq": "<ul>\n    <li><strong>Who should enroll in this course?</strong>\n\n        <p>The audience for this class includes: Those currently working in clinical\n            trials, pre-clinical development, regulatory and ethical review of research and students of public health, medicine, nursing, and biological sciences</p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Do I need a textbook for this course?</strong>\n\n        <p>All the material needed for this course can be found on the web or within\n            the lectures.

{"about_the_course": "Medical Neuroscience explores the organization and physiology of the human central nervous system. This course is designed for first-year students in graduate-level health professions programs. It builds upon knowledge acquired in prior studies of cellular and molecular biology, general physiology, and human anatomy. The course provides students an understanding of the essential principles of neurological function, from cellular and molecular mechanisms of neural signaling and plasticity to the organization and function of sensory and motor systems. This course emphasizes the neural and vascular anatomy of the human brain and spinal cord, providing an anatomical framework for localizing lesions within the central nervous system. It also emphasizes the neurobiological foundation for understanding mental illness and disorders of human behavior. <br><br> The overall goal is to equip students in the health professions for interpreting impairments of sensation, action and cognition that accompany neurological injury, disease or dysfunction. Students currently pursuing advanced studies in the brain sciences will benefit from this course by learning the fundamentals of functional human neuroanatomy and how neuroscience discovery translates to clinical practice.", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/medicalneuro/large-icon.png", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/medicalneuro/small-icon.hover.png", "large_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/medicalneuro/large-icon.png", "video": "q5kUhps_F0Q", "university-ids": ["duke"], "id": 59, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/65/b1eae360095757f04b8bfda5fdbb62/Duke_University_Logo.svg", "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "DukeNews", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cc/500c9f41731d797a0e108a4edd8bc1/favicon-duke.ico", "website_facebook": "DukeUniv", "id": 7, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/67/20d9fca42bddac2034668d7b589cad/dukewidelogo_vert.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Durham", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 35.9940329, "location": "Durham, NC, USA", "primary_color": "#003366", "abbr_name": "Duke", "website": "http://duke.edu/", "description": "Home of the Blue Devils, Duke University has about 13,000 undergraduate and graduate students and a world-class faculty helping to expand the frontiers of knowledge.

{"about_the_course": "This course explores the history of the modern world since Chinggis Khan. It focuses on the connections between societies from the time of the Mongol conquests and the gradual, but accelerating ways in which connections became ties of inter-dependence. The relations between societies are what will concern us. The forces pulling the world together vary from religious to economic, political to intellectual. These forces bring the world together, but they also create new divisions. Nowadays, we call this \"globalization.\" That term has tended to emphasize the drive to worldwide integration; the view of globalization taken in this course emphasizes disintegration as well as integration. We will tackle some very basic questions: How do we explain the staggering wealth of China in the centuries up to 1750, as well as China's recent ascent? Where did the United States come from, and where is it headed? What are the significance and legacies of empire in the world? How have world wars and revolutions shaped the international system over time? What exactly is globalization, and how does today's globalization compare with the past? How has the relationship between humans and nature changed over the centuries?", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/wh1300/large-icon.png", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/wh1300/small-icon.hover.png", "large_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/wh1300/large-icon.png", "video": "lNP8w6b217I", "university-ids": ["princeton"], "id": 45, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": "", "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "princeton", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d4/29daf4b768e1aa467202d4d2dcf8d8/favicon-princeton.ico", "website_facebook": "PrincetonU", "id": 4, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/94/cc9200e336d38ce029873b13cbe93b/logo-princeton-front.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "", "location_country": "", "location_lat": null, "location": "", "primary_color": "#BA632D", "abbr_name": "Princeton", "website": "http://www.princeton.edu/", "description": "Princeton University is a private research university located in Princeton, New Jersey, United States.

Growth can be good and growth can be bad. There is no scientific basis for the axiom \"grow or die\". It is a fiction. You will lean from Julie Allinson, the founder of Eyebobs, who has built a successful business selling stylish \u201creading glasses for the irreverent and slightly jaded.\u201d Julie approached growth realistically and understood its value creation and destructive powers. You will learn how she faced manufacturing, sales, and people challenges while building a high growth business\u2014a cool story.</div>\n<div></div>\n<br>\n<div><strong>Week 2: Workshop\u2014\u201cAre You Ready for Growth?\u201d: &nbsp;</strong>Using the Growth Risks Assessment Tool from Week 1, you will meet and advise Susan Fellers, the founder of 3 Fellers Bakery. Susan started a business baking gluten-free products when she was diagnosed with celiac disease. Her start-up was successful, and she needs your help because she has had so many growth alternatives and she does not know which to pursue. You will be asked to create a growth plan for her.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<br>\n<div><strong>Week 3: The 4 Ps of Growth\u2014Planning, Prioritization, Processes and Pace:</strong> Using the Defender Direct story, we will learn to better manage the chaos of growth; find a business's strategic focus; how to choose which daily \"fires\" to put out first; how to create replicable processes\u2014\u201cleave a fire extinguisher behind\"; and how to pace growth letting \"up on the growth gas pedal\". Dave Lindsey is our business builder this week, and you will trace his story from starting his business in his home to today being a national, privately owned home installation company generating well in excess of $300M (USD) in revenue with healthy profit numbers.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<br>\n<div><strong>Week 4: The Four Ways To Grow a Business: </strong>This week you will learn about the different ways to grow\u2014improvements, innovation, scaling, and strategic acquisitions\u2014with a focus on growth boosters: how to get more customers and sell more products and/or services to existing customers more efficiently. Enchanting Travels, a travel company based in India, is our story this week. You will learn how they built the foundation of their business to scale their focused customer value proposition so they could grow geographically to Africa, South America, and Asia. The story presents a big decision for you: should they franchise their business?</div>\n<div></div>\n<br>\n<div><strong>Week 5: Workshop\u2014\u201cCreating a Growth Plan\": </strong>This week you will read about Eric Barger's challenge: how to take a business that has had little growth selling a commodity product and turn it into a high growth business. You will be asked to create a growth plan for Eric. And after doing that you will learn what Eric did to quadruple his business in three years.&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>", "description": "", "short_name": "growtogreatness", "target_audience": 0, "faq": "<ul>\n<li><strong><strong><strong>Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?<br></strong></strong></strong>Yes.

{"about_the_course": "<p>Computation and simulation are increasingly important in all aspects of\n    science and engineering. At the same time writing efficient computer programs\n    to take full advantage of current computers is becoming increasingly difficult.\n    Even laptops now have 4 or more processors, but using them all to solve\n    a single problem faster often requires rethinking the algorithm to introduce\n    parallelism, and then programming in a language that can express this parallelism.&nbsp;\n    Writing efficient programs also requires some knowledge of machine arithmetic,\n    computer architecture, and memory hierarchies.</p>\n<p>Although parallel computing will be covered, this is <i>not</i> a class\n    on the most advanced techniques for using supercomputers, which these days\n    have tens of thousands of processors and cost millions of dollars. Instead,\n    the goal is to teach tools that you can use immediately on your own laptop,\n    desktop, or a small cluster. Cloud computing will also be discussed, and\n    students who don't have a multiprocessor computer of their own will still\n    be able to do projects using Amazon Web Services at very low cost.</p>\n<p>Along the way there will also be discussion of software engineering tools\n    such as debuggers, unit testing, Makefiles, and the use of version control\n    systems. After all, your time is more valuable than computer time, and\n    a program that runs fast is totally useless if it produces the wrong results.</p>\n<p>High performance <i>programming</i> is also an important aspect of high\n    performance scientific computing, and so another main theme of the course\n    is the use of basic tools and techniques to improve your efficiency as\n    a computational scientist.</p>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f9/e0f36e25d08cf39f031af42998ea7e/large-icon.png", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/e1/a5ce1b0f39e7d455bd2e067b6cf6e1/large-icon.png", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f8/48381a4cbd67e4c6173d6fc0de5d40/large-icon.png", "video": "1m32LiqOlj0", "university-ids": ["uw"], "id": 119, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": "", "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/98/7480c1f9271144aa75fe024a1ad5a0/favicon-uw.ico", "website_facebook": "", "id": 15, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/53/2f0ff155b3390e3d7190c363a4a045/uw-logo-coursera-transparent.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Seattle", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 47.6062095, "location": "Seattle, WA", "primary_color": "#38255a", "abbr_name": "Washington", "website": "https://www.washington.edu/", "description": "", "short_name": "uw", "location_state": "WA", "website_youtube": "", "banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/82756d3357ccb0a34484c6dcf02c5e/banner-uw.jpg", "landing_page_banner": "", "name": "University of Washington", "square_logo": "", "square_logo_source": "", "display": true, "location_lng": -122.3320708, "home_link": null, "class_logo": "", "square_logo_svg": ""}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "", "course_syllabus": "<p>The use of a variety of languages and techniques will be integrated throughout\n    the course as much as possible, rather than taught linearly.

{"about_the_course": "<div>In bringing about behavior change in public health, we often focus on the individual mother, student, or farmer. We should not forget the community structure and norms constrain for encouraging individual health behaviors. This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote the public\u2019s health. We begin by examining the various definitions of \u2018community\u2019 and the processes by which we \u2018diagnose\u2019 or seek to understand the structure and characteristics of different types of communities. An appreciation of community similarities and differences is necessary lest we fall into the trap of designing one-size-fits-all interventions. We need to recognize that no matter that outsiders may view a community as poor or neglected, we can find strengths and capacities for improvement in each community. Identifying community capacities and resources is the first step in facilitating community change. Different practical and philosophical approaches to change and therefore, examined. Specific to the change process is our recognition of the need for communities to participate in the design, implementation and evaluation of any intervention. We examine the concept of participation in an effort to see how different levels of involvement may affect sustainability of community change efforts. Finally a case study of a community participatory approach to onchocerciasis control in Africa is presented. Community Directed Intervention has subsequently been successfully applied to providing other essential primary health care services by and in the community, such as insecticide treated bednets, malaria treatment, vitamin A distribution, deworming medicines, and pneumonia and diarrhea case management.<br><br></div>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/communitychange/large-icon.png", "preview_link": "", "small_icon_hover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/communitychange/small-icon.hover.png", "large_icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/communitychange/large-icon.png", "video": "xxDMpBRv0u8", "university-ids": ["jhu"], "id": 74, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "JohnsHopkins", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/80/d81353ccd0bab30962a5770d7aec97/favicon-jhu.ico", "website_facebook": "johnshopkinsuniversity", "id": 8, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cf/0db65d1501244b9e6eacfa5e637fea/logo-jhu-front.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Baltimore", "location_country": "US", "location_lat": 39.2903848, "location": "Baltimore, MD", "primary_color": "#0061AA", "abbr_name": "Johns Hopkins", "website": "http://www.jhu.edu/", "description": "The mission of The Johns Hopkins University is to educate its students and cultivate their capacity for life-long learning, to foster independent and original research, and to bring the benefits of discovery to the world.", "short_name": "jhu", "location_state": "MD", "website_youtube": "johnshopkins", "banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/83/94437b11dcbef874ea1f30d960a26b/banner-jhu.jpg", "landing_page_banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c2/544537cee93c0acd67b6573d46a32e/Coursera-banner.jpg", "name": "Johns Hopkins University", "square_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f6/4798f308d4eaa66fc53e99a92d65e5/JHU_360x360.png", "square_logo_source": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/39/7f8dfbe935fe6b3f1eb2e85e307375/JHU_360x360.png", "display": true, "location_lng": -76.61218930000001, "home_link": null, "class_logo": "", "square_logo_svg": ""}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "http://coursera-course-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/a9/61acb25a805dbaf8da2f498acae5bd/logo-jhu-course.png", "course_syllabus": "<div>\n<div>After listening to, viewing, and studying the course materials, you will:</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide a definition of community</li>\n<li>Identify community components, characteristics, and typologies</li>\n<li>Outline and explain the components of a community diagnosis</li>\n<li>Explain the concept of perceived community/collective efficacy</li>\n<li>Outline and describe the community competency model</li>\n<li>Explain Rothman's model of community change</li>\n<li>Note relationships of Rothman's model to other change models</li>\n<li>Describe the levels of the political economy model</li>\n<li>Give examples of a political economy interpretation to health problems</li>\n<li>Define the concept of community coalitions</li>\n<li>Identify the role of community participation in the Alma Ata Declaration</li>\n<li>Provide examples of the effect of participation on program outcomes</li>\n<li>Describe how coalitions can address urban health problems</li>\n<li>Describe the levels of participation along a continuum</li>\n<li>Distinguish between community-based and community-controlled programming</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>", "description": "", "short_name": "communitychange", "target_audience": 1, "faq": "<ul>\n<li><strong>What resources will I need for this class?</strong>\n<p>There is no specific text book for the course.

This course explores linkages between climate change\n    and other pressing priorities such as human health, poverty, community\n    livability, economic resilience, and other environmental problems (such\n    as biodiversity and water quality).&nbsp; We acknowledge the urgent need\n    to design innovative strategies that realize multiple objectives (or co-benefits)\n    simultaneously, and explore the particular capacity for sustainability\n    and climate change to provide an avenue for achieving these objectives.&nbsp;</p>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/34/3695b2ea7c68d91a1372216c456582/Sustainability-s-Earth01.jpg", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/52/79f2b266c299e1a83fa5adfc366192/Sustainability-s-Earth01.jpg", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/e3/7f5ab4618e5c245533c79c8454a2b5/Sustainability-s-Earth01.jpg", "video": "zB6jr34HzZY", "university-ids": ["ubc"], "id": 226, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d1/159770b1b64f0bb3736e0a1ad5144b/favicon.ico", "website_facebook": "", "id": 29, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d1/4b45f1fa68329d09b869d990e5d48e/panel_signature3.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "", "location_country": "", "location_lat": null, "location": "", "primary_color": "#0f2144", "abbr_name": "UBC", "website": "", "description": "", "short_name": "ubc", "location_state": "", "website_youtube": "", "banner": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dd/396bbc8612e8d7bd419bdffa4c9f36/ubc4.jpg", "landing_page_banner": null, "name": "The University of British Columbia", "square_logo": null, "square_logo_source": null, "display": true, "location_lng": null, "home_link": null, "class_logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/bf/ec7f82fa9a5710bd93265b426dcebd/s1b282.png", "square_logo_svg": null}], "self_service_course_id": null, "university_logo": "", "course_syllabus": "<p>Climate Literacy is delivered in ten Modules.&nbsp; The first half of\n    the course deals mainly with climate change science and models, while the\n    second half of the course speaks to climate change impacts, response options,\n    and polices.&nbsp; The Modules are as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>1.\n</b><b>&nbsp;Climate in the public sphere</b>\n</p>\n<p>Climate change is a pervasive and challenging phenomenon that can be viewed\n    through a multitude of lenses. A scientific lens, for instance, reveals\n    altered ecosystems and climatic tipping points while the lens of ethics\n    raises the question of the right to develop and influence the well-being\n    of others while doing so. This module will introduce you to a few of the\n    core concepts that you will need to delve deeper into the science and policy\n    of climate change. We will explore the broad findings offered by the scientific\n    community with regard to our influence on the climate system, the policy\n    tools that we have developed to respond to this challenge, and the core\n    of the climate change debate in scientific, political, and lay communities.</p>\n<p><b>2.\n</b><b>&nbsp;Introduction to the climate system</b>\n</p>\n<p>In Module 2 we\u2019re looking at the big picture, and asking: \u201cWhat\u2019s the\n    climate system made of, and how has it evolved over time?\u201d We\u2019ll paint\n    a broad sketch of how climate works by describing what we see around us\n    now and by using climate records to tell a stripped down version of the\n    last 500 million years of climate history. Drawing from your daily experience,\n    we\u2019ll also discuss and illustrate the properties of dynamic systems, and\n    see how the concept of system dynamics can help us understand how climate\n    change happens.</p>\n<p><b>3.\n</b><b>&nbsp;The\nenergy budget of the earth</b>\n</p>\n<p>This module covers the basics of climatology at the planetary scale. We\n    won\u2019t look at how regional climates are created, or how energy is distributed\n    and flows between various regions of the Earth, but rather consider the\n    planet as a whole. We will trace the path of energy coming in from the\n    Sun and leaving the planet as thermal radiation (or infrared), and explore\n    the various factors affecting these flows: greenhouse gases, aerosols,\n    ground cover albedo, and clouds. We will investigate how humans have impacted\n    these climatic controls since the Industrial Revolution, and compare these\n    anthropogenic forcings to natural forcings such as variation in solar irradiance\n    and volcanic eruptions.</p>\n<p><b>4.\n</b><b>The carbon cycle</b>\n</p>\n<p>Our planet breathes; its biosphere on land and in the oceans inhales and\n    exhales oxygen and carbon dioxide every second. Even water and rocks exchange\n    carbon dioxide with the atmosphere. Humans, particularly through deforestation\n    and fossil fuel use, are only a small part of this planetary carbon cycle,\n    but one that has had significant impact. This module explores the natural\n    carbon cycle, and the impact humans have had on it since the Industrial\n    Revolution.</p>\n<p><b>5.\n</b><b>&nbsp;Climate models</b>\n</p>\n<p>The epistemology and method of climate science (and of earth sciences\n    in general) is somewhat different than that of other sciences. Most research\n    in physics, chemistry and biology (to name only a few) happens in a laboratory.\n    There, the scientist can test her understanding of the phenomena she studies\n    by doing repeated experiments, changing a few key parameters and seeing\n    how they impact the results. Climate scientists obviously cannot learn\n    what the impact of various GHG emission scenarios might be by \u201ctrying it\n    out\u201d, or cannot see what would happen if you were to change circulation\n    patterns or increase the number of clouds. There is no laboratory large\n    enough fit the Earth, no lever long enough to change its conditions at\n    will, and no observer patient enough to look on as the experiment unfolds.\n    Or at least, we can\u2019t do it more than once!</p>\n<p>Climatologists depend on computer models to do these experiments. Of course\n    these models don\u2019t appear out of thin air \u2013 they are built on our understanding\n    of basic physics and Earth processes, which is built on field observations\n    and lab experiments. These models are calibrated and tested using data\n    from direct measurements or based on reconstructions of past climates.</p>\n<p>This module introduces climate models: how they work, how they are tested,\n    what their limits are, and how they can be used to forecast possible futures.</p>\n<p><b>6.\n</b><b>&nbsp;The\nclimate forecast</b>\n</p>\n<p>Now that we have a clearer sense of the history, principles, components\n    and assumptions of climate models, we\u2019ll look more closely at their results.\n    In the first lesson we review global projections made by the IPCC for the\n    coming century, based on the various SRES scenarios: What range of temperature\n    increases can we expect? How will that affect the climatic factors that\n    are most relevant to humans and ecosystems: precipitation, circulation\n    patterns, extreme events, melting of snow and ice, etc? These global projections\n    give us the main line of what we can expect if we embark on various emission\n    and development paths, and offer a broad view for decision-making. However,\n    for local planners and decision-makers, these results are not directly\n    relevant: the spatial scales are too large, and important local details\n    that will control the impact on a local scale are not resolved. In the\n    second lecture we address this issue and explore the tools available to\n    downscale global projections to a local scale, and discuss how these tools\n    can be used by local decision-makers in government and industry for long-term\n    strategic planning.</p>\n<p><b>7.\n</b><b>&nbsp;Climate change impacts</b>\n</p>\n<p>As we have seen, the emission of vast quantities of greenhouse gases by\n    humans fundamentally influences the global climatic system. The chain reaction\n    does not end here, however. Rising temperatures and sea levels, changing\n    precipitation patterns, and ocean acidification, for instance, trigger\n    dramatic shifts in the way that human and natural systems function.</p>\n<p>This module forms the transition between the science of climate change,\n    which we have explored in Modules 2-6, and the more human-oriented Modules\n    7-10.</p>\n<p><b>8.\n</b><b>&nbsp;Climate change mitigation: dealing with the\ncauses</b>\n</p><b>\n\n</b>\n<p>Now that we understand the central causes of anthropogenic climate change,\n    and the impacts that we can expect to (and already) experience, the next\n    step is to explore the response options that are available to us. The most\n    commonly-discussed response to climate change is mitigation: tackling the\n    causes of climate change by reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases\n    in the atmosphere. The aim of mitigation is to reduce the severity and\n    frequency of climate change impacts, thereby protecting ecosystems and\n    human societies.</p>\n<p>This module will explore the basic concept of mitigation, the core mitigation\n    strategies that we currently have available to us, the innovative action\n    that is being taken around the world, and leading-edge ideas with regard\n    to tackling the roots of climate change. By the end of this module, you\n    will be able to critique the likelihood of implementation of many of these\n    strategies, and will have a framework through which you can learn more\n    about greenhouse gas management, both at home and around the world.</p>\n<p><b>9.\n</b><b>&nbsp;Climate change adaptation: dealing with the\neffects</b>\n</p>\n<p>In contrast to the previous module, this module introduces the idea of\n    addressing the impacts of climate change rather than its causes. In particular,\n    we will explore the various adaptation strategies that are available to\n    be utilized around the world, the heated debate surrounding the equity\n    implications of adaptation, and the linkages between adaptation and mitigation.\n    By the end of this module we will have explored the difference between\n    proactive and reactive adaptation, and our track record with both. We will\n    outline the most common and effective adaptation strategies, including\n    those related to human settlements, ecosystems, and the broader issue of\n    development. Finally, we will explore the inevitable trade-offs between\n    adaptation and mitigation, setting us up to finish this course with a survey\n    of climate change response policies.</p>\n<p><b>10.\n</b><b>&nbsp;Policy\ntools for mitigation and adaptation</b>\n</p>\n<p>This Module forms a bridge between this first course in the Decision-making\n    for Climate Change series, and the three courses that will follow. Given\n    what we know now about the science behind climate change, and the strategies\n    that we have at our disposal for responding to it, we can now be introduced\n    to policies that bear this in mind. After being introduced to the fundamentals\n    of mitigation and adaptation policy, we will use the British Columbia carbon\n    tax and the proposed cap-and-trade system in the United States as relevant\n    examples. Finally, we will finish with a glimpse forward to the future\n    of climate change policy, and the most promising opportunities for both\n    managing impacts and ensuring a rapid transition to a fundamentally low-carbon\n    development path.</p>", "description": "", "short_name": "climateliteracy", "target_audience": 0, "faq": "", "category-ids": ["energy"], "visibility": 0, "short_description": "Climate Literacy tackles the scientific and socio-political dimensions of climate change.

{"about_the_course": "<b></b>We are part of the 'TechniCity'. The increasing availability of networks, sensors and mobile technologies allows for new approaches to address the challenges that our cities face. The way we understand cities is undergoing sweeping transformation, right along with the analytical tools we use to design our cities and the communication tools we use to engage people. Absorbing, studying and understanding the role of technology from a critical viewpoint allows us to generate creative ideas for improving our cities.&nbsp;<br><br>This course begins by examining how our cities are changing. We then jump into how technology is used to engage with the public to support decision-making. Students will be examining tools for analyzing the city. Then we move into exploring the infrastructure that makes the real-time, technologically-enhanced city possible. And rounding out the course is an exploration of entrepreneurial urbanism, looking at how creativity can spawn technological innovation. You'll hear from technological innovators and thought leaders about all of these topics.

{"about_the_course": "<div>This course is about molecular evolution - the evolution of DNA, RNA, and protein molecules. The focus is on computational methods for inferring phylogenetic trees from sequence data, and the course will cover the fundamental theory and algorithms, while also giving the student hands-on experience with some widely used software tools. Since evolutionary theory is the conceptual foundation of biology (in the words of Theodosius Dobzhansky: \"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution\"), what you learn on this course will be relevant for any project you will ever do inside the life sciences. A phylogenetic tree will almost always help you think more clearly about your biological problem.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A special emphasis is put on methods that employ explicit models of the evolutionary process (maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches), and we will explore the role of statistical modeling in molecular evolution, and in science more generally. A mathematical (statistical) model of a biological system can be considered to be a stringently phrased hypothesis about that system, and this way of thinking about models will often be helpful. In addition to model-based methods, you will also learn about other approaches, such as those based on parsimony and genetic distance (<i>e.g.</i>, neighbor joining).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Often, the evolutionary tree &nbsp;is the result we are interested in - knowing how a set of sequences (or organisms) are related can provide us with important information about the biological problem we are &nbsp;investigating. For instance, knowing which organisms are most closely related to a newly identified, uncharacterized, pathogenic bacterium will allow you to infer many aspects of its lifestyle, thereby giving you important clues about how to fight it. In other cases, however, inferring the structure of the tree is not the goal: for instance, our main focus may instead be the detection of positions in a protein undergoing positive selection (indicating adaptation) or negative selection (indicating conserved functional importance). However, even in these cases, the underlying phylogenetic tree <i>will</i> be an important part of our hypothesis about (model of) how the proteins have been evolving, and will help in getting the correct answer.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Although the study of molecular evolution does require a certain level of mathematical understanding, this course has been designed to be accessible also for students with limited computational background (e.g., students of biology).</div><div><br></div><div>Topics covered:<br><br></div><ul><li>Brief introduction to evolutionary theory and population genetics.</li><li>Mechanisms of molecular evolution.</li><li>Models of DNA and protein substitution.</li><li>Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees using parsimony, distance based methods, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian techniques.</li><li>Advanced models of nucleotide substitution (gamma-distributed mutation rates, molecular clock models, codon models and analysis of selective pressure).</li><li>Statistical analysis of biological hypotheses (likelihood ratio tests, non-parametric and parametric bootstrapping, Bayesian statistics).</li></ul><div><br></div>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c0/3c822f759b1d4d312426a1b8c219be/green_lime4.png", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/4c/7b8be574c6d1d4eecbf766fb41ce9a/green_lime4.png", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/3b/f49feb83ae9131afb90d59db8a37cf/green_lime4.png", "video": "SCj2vAtYqho", "university-ids": ["dtu"], "id": 367, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/8b/1ab7b5448abdcd28732eb55226c501/DTUlogoSmall_nobg.png", "website_facebook": "", "id": 57, "logo": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/83/a89363d6f10e342ec8bba3d06e91ce/dtu_logo_nobg.png", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "Lyngby", "location_country": "DK", "location_lat": 55.763516, "location": "Kongens Lyngby, Denmark", "primary_color": "#97141a", "abbr_name": "DTU", "website": "http://www.dtu.dk/English.aspx", "description": "DTU focuses on research in technical and natural sciences that contributes to the development of society.

{"about_the_course": "<p>Scandinavia is well known internationally\nfor its welfare society, and part of this welfare society is a very developed\ncultural policy based on both the free market and public support. Scandinavia\nhas a strong film and television culture with institutions and traditions\ncreated to secure creative diversity for both national, Scandinavian and global\naudiences. In many ways Scandinavian film and television is a global cultural\nbrand, connected with and exporting some of the cultural and social values\nconnected to a liberal and progressive welfare society. Dating back to the\nsilent cinema era and through the birth of a modern film and television culture\nafter 1945 Scandinavia has contributed significantly to our global cultural\nheritage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>This course in <i>Scandinavian Film and Television</i> deals with the social,\ninstitutional and cultural background of film and television in Scandinavia and\nin a broader European and global context. The course will offer a deeper\nunderstanding of the creative forces behind film and television, of how\nScandinavian society and culture has influenced the production. The course will\ndeal with the co-production in Scandinavia and the role of Scandinavian film\nand television internationally. Theoretically the course will deal with\nnational and global cinema, with film and media sociology, with genre and\nauteur theory and with film and media policy.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>The course will also deal with some of the\nmost important film directors and film and television genres and the way they\nhave reflected and influenced our understanding of Scandinavia and the image of\nScandinavian culture and society abroad. From Carl Th. Dreyer\u2019s complex\nhistorical and religious dramas, Ingmar Bergman\u2019s symbolic and psychological\nfilms to the modern cinema of Lars von Trier, Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki, Lukas Moodyson\nand Bent Hamer - all important Scandinavian names in a broader European art\ncinema tradition.&nbsp; The course will deal\nwith typical examples of other and more popular genres in Scandinavian cinema\nand modern, Scandinavian television drama and with aspects of the Scandinavian\ndocumentary tradition. Examples include Jan Troell\u2019s epic serial <i>The Immigrants/The New Land </i>(1971-72), global,\nprize winning drama series like <i>The\nKilling</i> (2007-12) and <i>Borgen</i> (2010-)\nand international film blockbusters such as the Stieg Larson trilogy.</span></p>", "other_description": "", "photo": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/22/c796d9046014cdcd7cbccac941de43/scandinavian_film.jpg", "preview_link": null, "small_icon_hover": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/76/691bbbbdc23d7d44bdad9fda989993/scandinavian_film.jpg", "large_icon": "https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ba/3c3c20f06dcd7b998519c5ed9925ce/scandinavian_film.jpg", "video": "", "university-ids": ["ucph"], "id": 400, "universities": [{"rectangular_logo_svg": null, "wordmark": null, "website_twitter": "uni_copenhagen", "favicon": "https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/55/45a9eafa2bfdb29d961f8472a0b7fa/favicon_fa.ico", "website_facebook": "universitet", "id": 63, "logo": "", "background_color": "", "mailing_list_id": null, "location_city": "CPH", "location_country": "DK", "location_lat": 55.6760968, "location": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "primary_color": "#901a1e", "abbr_name": "UCPH", "website": "http://www.ku.dk/english", "description": "The University of Copenhagen is the oldest University in Denmark - founded in 1479, and with over 38,000 students and more than 9,000 employees.
