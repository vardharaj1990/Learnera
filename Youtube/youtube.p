VThe History of English in Ten Minutes
p265
aVWhere did the phrase 'a wolf in sheep's clothing' come from? And when did scientists finally get round to naming sexual body parts? Voiced by Clive Anderson, this entertaining romp through 'The History of English' squeezes 1600 years of history into 10 one-minute bites, uncovering the sources of English words and phrases from Shakespeare and the King James Bible to America and the Internet.  Bursting with fascinating facts, the series looks at how English grew from a small tongue into a major global language before reflecting on the future of English in the 21st century.

VWorlds of English
p275
aVHow has the English language spread internationally - and is the worldwide influence of English a cause for celebration or concern? How is it changing in response to social, cultural, and technological developments? 'Worlds of English' investigates these notions by looking at the expansion of English in China since the 1970s, how it is now the dominant language used at the European Parliament and how a local vernacular in Singapore, known as 'Singlish' is causing controversy. It also examines the role of, and attitude towards, English since the end of Apartheid. This material forms part of the Open University course U214 Worlds of English.

aVWhat is type 1 diabetes? How do people with diabetes manage their symptoms? Type 1 diabetes occurs when insulin producing cells are destroyed, and the body can no longer produce the insulin needed to control sugar levels in the blood.  It can develop at any age, but most commonly emerges in childhood.  Diabetics must ensure that they don't have too much or too little sugar in their blood as either extreme can cause medical complications. In this collection, 21-year old Clemmy reveals what it is like to have high blood sugar, and 22-year old Sam shares his experiences of dealing with low levels of blood sugar.

Attention is given to the implications of Spiritual Theology for seminary training and classroom experience. Particular attention is given to understanding the implications of life in Christ regarding guilt, shame and legalism as well as the New Covenant ministry of the Spirit in transforming the heart in light of the dynamics of original sin, early relational development and the habits of sin developed over time. Attention is also given to developmental spirituality, how the Spirit transforms the heart over time and how this affects ministries of teaching, preaching and discipleship in the church.

p982
aVView the complete course: http://ocw.mit.edu/11-965IAP07\u000aInstructor: Ceasar McDowell, Claudia Canepa, Sebastiao Ferriera\u000a\u000aThe course is an introduction to the approach of Reflective Practice developed by Donald Schön. It is an approach that enables professionals to understand how they use their knowledge in practical situations and how they can combine practice and learning in a more effective way. Through greater awareness of how they deploy their knowledge in practical situations, professionals can increase their capacities of learning in a more timely way. Understanding how they frame situations and ideas helps professionals to achieve greater flexibility and increase their capacity of conceptual innovation.\u000a\u000aThe objective of the course is to introduce students to the approach and methods of reflective practice by raising their awareness about their own cognitive resources and how they use them in their practice. The course will introduce theories of learning, knowledge generation, framing and reframing, theories of action, reflection-in-practice, and conceptual innovation, and provide students with opportunities to experiment with these theories in real life through practical exercises in which they reflect on real situations that they have faced in their past professional experience. Through these practical exercises, students will have the opportunity to reflect on their thinking capacities in the context of their practice.

p1093
aVThis course presents and at the same time critiques a narrative world history after 1500 CE. The purpose of the course is to convey an understanding of how this rapidly growing field of history is being approached at three different levels: the narrative textbook level, the theoretical-conceptual level, and through discussion sections, the research level.

VEuropean Civiliization (1648-1945) with John Merriman
p1148
aVThis course offers a broad survey of modern European history, from the end of the Thirty Years' War to the aftermath of World War II. Along with the consideration of major events and figures such as the French Revolution and Napoleon, attention will be paid to the experience of ordinary people in times of upheaval and transition. The period will thus be viewed neither in terms of historical inevitability nor as a procession of great men, but rather through the lens of the complex interrelations between demographic change, political revolution, and cultural development. Textbook accounts will be accompanied by the study of exemplary works of art, literature, and cinema.

VHistory 5, 001 - Fall 2010
p1176
aVThis course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe--a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place-- became the motor of globalization and a world civilzation in its own right. Put differently how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern".

VDante in Translation with Giuseppe Mazzotta
p1220
aVThe course is an introduction to Dante and his cultural milieu through a critical reading of the Divine Comedy and selected minor works (Vita nuova, Convivio, De vulgari eloquentia, Epistle to Cangrande). An analysis of Dante's autobiography, the Vita nuova, establishes the poetic and political circumstances of the Comedy's composition. Readings of Inferno, Purgatory and Paradise seek to situate Dante's work within the intellectual and social context of the late Middle Ages, with special attention paid to political, philosophical and theological concerns. Topics in the Divine Comedy explored over the course of the semester include the relationship between ethics and aesthetics; love and knowledge; and exile and history.

VIntroduction to Political Philosophy with Steven B. Smith
p1693
aVThis course is intended as an introduction to political philosophy as seen through an examination of some of the major texts and thinkers of the Western political tradition. Three broad themes that are central to understanding political life are focused upon: the polis experience (Plato, Aristotle), the sovereign state (Machiavelli, Hobbes), constitutional government (Locke), and democracy (Rousseau, Tocqueville). The way in which different political philosophies have given expression to various forms of political institutions and our ways of life are examined throughout the course.

VCourse | Technology Entrepreneurship
p1940
aVThis course introduces the fundamentals of technology entrepreneurship, pioneered in Silicon Valley and now influencing other locations around the world. You will learn the process used by technology entrepreneurs to start companies.  It involves taking a technology idea and finding a high-potential commercial opportunity, gathering resources such as talent and capital, figuring out how to sell and market the idea, and managing rapid growth.\u000a\u000aThe class demonstrates the entrepreneurial mindset ... when others see insurmountable problems, people look for opportunities in technology and business solutions. A technology entrepreneurial perspective is also a wonderful way of thinking in order to tackle new opportunities in social entrepreneurship, whether it is in government or NGOs (non-profits).

p2004
aVView the complete course: http://ocw.mit.edu/21A-453S04\u000aInstructor: Susan Slyomovics\u000a\u000aThis course examines traditional performances of the Arabic-speaking populations of the Middle East and North Africa. Starting with the history of the ways in which the West has discovered, translated and written about the Orient, we will consider how power and politics play roles in the production of culture, narrative and performance. This approach assumes that performance, verbal art, and oral literature lend themselves to spontaneous adaptation and to oblique expression of ideas and opinions whose utterance would otherwise be censorable or disruptive. In particular we will be concerned with the way traditional performance practices are affected by and respond to the consequences of modernization.\u000a\u000aTopics include oral epic performance, sacred narrative, Koranic chant performance, the folktale, solo performance, cultural production and resistance.\u000a\u000aLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\u000aMore information at http://ocw.mit.edu/terms\u000aMore courses at http://ocw.mit.edu

VAlan Turing Centenary Lectures
p2462
aV2012 marks the centenary of the birth of Alan Turing, an event being celebrated worldwide. Turing is regarded by many as the originator of modern computing. His work had a strong influence in several fields: mathematics, logic, cryptology and morphogenesis, but it is perhaps in the field of computer science that his legacy has been the most profound. The University of Edinburgh and the Royal Society of Edinburgh present a series of lectures celebrating his achievements and reflecting on the impact of his work on modern life.

aVCourse Description:\u000aChemistry 14D: Organic Reactions and Pharmaceuticals is a class that provides an in depth analysis of organic reactions, nucleophilic and electrophilic substitutions and additions; electrophilic aromatic substitutions, carbonyl reactions, catalysis, molecular basis of drug action, and organic chemistry of pharmaceuticals.\u000a\u000aAbout the Professor:\u000aProfessor Hardinger has been a faculty member in the UCLA Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry since 1997. His professional career began at Drexel University in Philadelphia, which afforded a BS in Chemistry in 1982. He then moved to Purdue University, and earned a PhD in Organic Chemistry in 1988. Two subsequent years as a postdoctoral scholar at Renssalear Polytechnic Institute were followed by appointment in 1990 as assistant professor at California State University. In 1997 he achieved the "forbidden transition" and moved to UCLA as Lecturer followed by promotion to Senior Lecturer in 2004. At UCLA his main teaching interests have been introductory organic chemistry courses in the physical science majors series as well as the life science majors series. His professional interests include development of new teaching tools and methods, both in print and electronic media. An introductory organic chemistry textbook (Organic Chemistry - A Thinking Student's Approach) is currently in development.\u000a\u000aCourse Webpage: http://www.chem.ucla.edu/harding/\u000a\u000aNote: Some clips and images may have been blurred or removed to avoid copyright infringement. \u000a\u000a* See all the UCLA Chemistry 14D: Organic Reactions and Pharmaceuticals classes in this series: http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=4BE4AAFBFECDB2F8\u000a* See more courses from UCLA: http://www.youtube.com/uclacourses\u000a* See more from UCLA's main channel on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/ucla

aVCourse Description:\u000aGerman 59: Holocaust in Film and Literature is a course that provides insight into the History of Holocaust and its present memory through examination of challenges and problems encountered in trying to imagine its horror through media of literature and film.\u000a\u000aAbout the Professor:\u000aTodd Presner is Associate Professor of Germanic Languages, Comparative Literature, and Jewish Studies. His research focuses on German-Jewish intellectual and cultural history, the history of media, visual culture, digital humanities, and cultural geography. He is the author of two books: The first, Mobile Modernity: Germans, Jews, Trains (Columbia University Press, 2007), maps German-Jewish intellectual history onto the development of the railway system; the second, Muscular Judaism: The Jewish Body and the Politics of Regeneration (Routledge, 2007), analyzes the aesthetic dimensions of the strong Jewish body.\u000a\u000aNote: Some clips and images may have been blurred or removed to avoid copyright infringement. \u000a\u000a* See all the UCLA German 59: Holocaust in Film and Literature classes in this series: http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=E162D5967A29AA3B\u000a* See more courses from UCLA: http://www.youtube.com/uclacourses\u000a* See more from UCLA's main channel on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/ucla

It analyzes the concepts 'a Democratic state' and 'a Jewish state'. It examines the claim that the state of Israel cannot be both Jewish and Democratic from two perspectives: that of the Jewish-Arab conflict, and that of the internal Jewish conflict concerning religious vs. ethnic and cultural conceptions of Judaism. The course offers a conception of Israel as the nation-state of Jews and compares its arrangements to those prevailing in other modern nation-states. It also examines issues such as land ownership, citizenship, the Law of Return and the Palestinian Right of Return, education, equality of rights and duties, and the identity of the state and its place in a constitution.

The online revolution has moved rapidly but has the law managed to keep up with it and what has been the impact on our legal rights. These two films touch upon issues that have emerged as a result of a growing online community. This collection explores the complications that arise when attempting to reconcile how various countries use different laws to police an individual's omnipresent profile on the net as well as discussing who owns the information we publish when we create an online account.

p3806
aVWhat is type 1 diabetes? How do people with diabetes manage their symptoms? Type 1 diabetes occurs when insulin producing cells are destroyed, and the body can no longer produce the insulin needed to control sugar levels in the blood.  It can develop at any age, but most commonly emerges in childhood.  Diabetics must ensure that they don't have too much or too little sugar in their blood as either extreme can cause medical complications. In this collection, 21-year old Clemmy reveals what it is like to have high blood sugar, and 22-year old Sam shares his experiences of dealing with low levels of blood sugar.

p4358
aVView the complete course: http://ocw.mit.edu/11-965IAP07\u000aInstructor: Ceasar McDowell, Claudia Canepa, Sebastiao Ferriera\u000a\u000aThe course is an introduction to the approach of Reflective Practice developed by Donald Schön. It is an approach that enables professionals to understand how they use their knowledge in practical situations and how they can combine practice and learning in a more effective way. Through greater awareness of how they deploy their knowledge in practical situations, professionals can increase their capacities of learning in a more timely way. Understanding how they frame situations and ideas helps professionals to achieve greater flexibility and increase their capacity of conceptual innovation.\u000a\u000aThe objective of the course is to introduce students to the approach and methods of reflective practice by raising their awareness about their own cognitive resources and how they use them in their practice. The course will introduce theories of learning, knowledge generation, framing and reframing, theories of action, reflection-in-practice, and conceptual innovation, and provide students with opportunities to experiment with these theories in real life through practical exercises in which they reflect on real situations that they have faced in their past professional experience. Through these practical exercises, students will have the opportunity to reflect on their thinking capacities in the context of their practice.

VGender Equality Rights and Trade Conference
p4583
aVWhile trade treaties generate economic winners and have the potential to greatly enhance the incomes of those on the lower end of the economic scale, they also create losers -- and a disproportionate number are women, 70 per cent of the world's poor. Organized by The North-South Institute, in collaboration with the University of British Columbia's Asia Pacific Dispute Resolution Project and the University of Ottawa's Human Rights Research and Education Centre and School of International Development and Global Studies, the conference will examine the intersection between trade and gender equality rights and suggest strategies that policy makers and governments might consider to make global trade rules and international human rights obligations more mutually reinforcing. The Rt. Hon. Chief Justice, Beverely McLachlin, will be the keynote speaker.\u000aVidéo est disponible en anglais seulement.

aVGuitar Chords 101 presents Berklee's approach to the construction of chords, a method that focuses less on the shape of an individual chord, and more on the notes that the chord is based around. Students will learn to construct and play triads and basic 7th chords, as well as look at inversions and different chord voicings -- the basic foundations guitarists use to write or perform in any number of different styles.\u000a\u000aBuilding on the foundation of Guitar Chords 101, Guitar Chords 201 is the next level in Berklee's world-famous approach to guitar study, one in which players focus on the individual notes that make up a chord, rather than on the chord's shape. Guitar Chords 201 provides essential technical training that will improve your style, intonation, technique, time feel, and tone.

VBlues Guitar with Michael Williams
p4832
aVGuitarists who know the blues have a natural advantage over those that don't. No matter what style they chose to play -- jazz, rock, classical -- having a blues background provides guitarists with a foundation in form, control, feel and harmonies that can be used to advance their playing in any genre of music. Blues Guitar Workshop begins by teaching the 12-bar blues harmony, basic rhythm guitar technique, and the pentatonic and blues scale in the open position up the neck. You'll learn to incorporate some of the nuances of the masters into your playing - from doubling the bass over a shuffle in the style of Buddy Guy, to combining major and minor pentatonic scales in the style of B.B. King and T-Bone Walker. Through call and response exercises and playing in other grooves and tempos, you'll learn to pace your solos to create tension and release -- a technique mastered by all the greatest guitarists. You'll learn to reuse the concepts and musical elements to expand your musical foundation and enhance your ability, whether you're trying to bring a blues sound to your playing or adding more depth and feel to any other style.

Deze trend zien we nu zelfs in mobiele communicatiediensten, waarbij operator diensten als spraakverkeer en SMS steeds meer vervangen worden door Internet diensten als mobile Voip en Whatsapp.

aVDr. John Coe.\u000a\u000aIntroductory study of the nature of spiritual theology and formation, which attempts to understand the nature of new life in Christ, the process of formation in the Spirit and the directives for cooperating with His work. Attention is given to the implications of Spiritual Theology for seminary training and classroom experience. Particular attention is given to understanding the implications of life in Christ regarding guilt, shame and legalism as well as the New Covenant ministry of the Spirit in transforming the heart in light of the dynamics of original sin, early relational development and the habits of sin developed over time. Attention is also given to developmental spirituality, how the Spirit transforms the heart over time and how this affects ministries of teaching, preaching and discipleship in the church.

Although theological themes will occupy much of our attention, the course does not attempt a theological appropriation of the New Testament as scripture. Rather, the importance of the New Testament and other early Christian documents as ancient literature and as sources for historical study will be emphasized. A central organizing theme of the course will focus on the differences within early Christianity (-ies).

VCourse | Virology (Biology)
p5990
aVThe basic thesis of the course is that all viruses adopt a common strategy. The strategy is simple:\u000a\u000a1. Viral genomes are contained in metastable particles.\u000a\u000a2. Genomes encode gene products that promote an infectious cycle (mechanisms for genomes to enter cells, replicate, and exit in particles).\u000a\u000a3. Infection patterns range from benign to lethal; infections can overcome or co-exist with host defenses.\u000a\u000aThe course will emphasize the common reactions that must be completed by all viruses for successful reproduction within a host cell and survival and spread within a host population. The molecular basis of alternative reproductive cycles, the interactions of viruses with host organisms, and how these lead to disease are presented with examples drawn from a set of representative animal and human viruses, although selected bacterial viruses will be discussed.

A whitepaper was prepared, and in 2005 the Initiative was selected to go forward. The IIC's offices opened in spring 2006, and its first projects were selected that summer. Several of those projects continue at Harvard and at Massachusetts General Hospital as sponsored research. \u000a\u000aDuring its final year, 2009-10, the IIC's seminars and a subset of the projects were adopted by the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

aVCertezza delle regole per aiutare le infrastrutture\u000aLe criticità italiane analizzate dagli studiosi di Banca d'Italia, da Franco Bassanini e dal viceministro Ciaccia in un convegno Memit-Certet.\u000aIscriviti alla newsletter Bocconi http://info.unibocconi.it/newsletter/\u000a\u000aSe le infrastrutture sono "il carburante dell'economia", i provvedimenti che il governo sta prendendo serviranno a "mettere insieme i collegamenti con il resto d'Europa e a parlare con il mondo", ha affermato ieri il viceministro alle infrastrutture e trasporti, Mario Ciaccia, nel corso del convegno Le infrastrutture in Italia: dotazione, programmazione, realizzazione, organizzato da Certet e Memit in collaborazione con Banca d'Italia. Anche se non c'è accordo su come misurare il gap infrastrutturale italiano, il ministro si è detto convinto che servano almeno 100 miliardi di investimenti nei prossimi tre anni, con una maggiore attenzione alla qualità della spesa e con nuovi strumenti per finanziare i lavori. Oltre ai lavori sbloccati con gli ultimi provvedimenti, Ciaccia ha infatti rivendicato gli interventi che renderanno possibile l'utilizzo di project bond e obbligazioni di scopo, nonché il project financing per la costruzione di nuove carceri.\u000a\u000aUn punto critico, secondo il viceministro e gli altri partecipanti al convegno, rimane però la scarsa attrattività dell'Italia per gli investitori a lungo termine, come i fondi. "Senza la certezza di invarianza normativa", ha affermato Ciaccia, "si rimarrà sempre un paese a rischio".

p7008
aVLectures, recitations, and demonstrations covering topics related to differential equations.\u000a\u000aDifferential equations are the language in which the laws of nature are expressed. Understanding properties of solutions of differential equations is fundamental to much of contemporary science and engineering. Ordinary differential equations (ODE's) deal with functions of one variable, which can often be thought of as time. Topics include: Solution of first-order ODE's by analytical, graphical and numerical methods; Linear ODE's, especially second order with constant coefficients; Undetermined coefficients and variation of parameters; Sinusoidal and exponential signals: oscillations, damping, resonance; Complex numbers and exponentials; Fourier series, periodic solutions; Delta functions, convolution, and Laplace transform methods; Matrix and first order linear systems: eigenvalues and eigenvectors; and Non-linear autonomous systems: critical point analysis and phase plane diagrams. \u000a\u000aView the complete course: http://ocw.mit.edu/18-03SCF11\u000a\u000aLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\u000aMore information at http://ocw.mit.edu/terms\u000aMore courses at http://ocw.mit.edu

VGlobal Problems of Population Growth with Robert Wyman
p7224
aVThis survey course introduces students to the important and basic material on human fertility, population growth, the demographic transition and population policy. Topics include: the human and environmental dimensions of population pressure, demographic history; economic and cultural causes of demographic change, environmental carrying capacity and sustainability. Political, religious and ethical issues surrounding fertility: infanticide, abortion, contraception, son preference, government coercion, migration and the status of women. The lectures and readings attempt to balance theoretical and demographic scale analyses with studies of individual humans and communities. The perspective is global with both developed and developing countries included. Controversies on the causes, cures and effects of rapid population growth are also addressed.

It is an approach that enables professionals to understand how they use their knowledge in practical situations and how they can combine practice and learning in a more effective way. Through greater awareness of how they deploy their knowledge in practical situations, professionals can increase their capacities of learning in a more timely way. Understanding how they frame situations and ideas helps professionals to achieve greater flexibility and increase their capacity of conceptual innovation.\u000a\u000aThe objective of the course is to introduce students to the approach and methods of reflective practice by raising their awareness about their own cognitive resources and how they use them in their practice. The course will introduce theories of learning, knowledge generation, framing and reframing, theories of action, reflection-in-practice, and conceptual innovation, and provide students with opportunities to experiment with these theories in real life through practical exercises in which they reflect on real situations that they have faced in their past professional experience. Through these practical exercises, students will have the opportunity to reflect on their thinking capacities in the context of their practice.

VMIT Understanding Lasers and Fiberoptics
p7511
aVLasers are essential to an incredibly large number of applications. Today, they are used in bar code readers, compact discs, medicine, communications, sensors, materials processing, computer printers, data processing, 3D-imaging, spectroscopy, navigation, non-destructive testing, chemical processing, color copiers, laser "shows", and in the military. There is hardly a field untouched by the laser. But what exactly is so unique about lasers that makes them so effective?\u000a\u000aThis brief video course is designed for engineers, scientists, medical personnel, managers, and others who work with lasers and/or fiberoptics, or who anticipate working with lasers and/or fiberoptics, yet have little or no background in laser or fiberoptic basics. The course focuses on fundamentals and emphasizes a physical intuitive interpretation of laser and fiberoptic phenomena and their applications. Because Prof. Ezekiel keeps mathematics to a minimum, the topics covered are easily understood, without the need for a strong technical background. Prof. Ezekiel uses plain language, graphic illustrations, and video demonstrations to explain the basic characteristics of lasers and fiberoptics.

V- Economics
p7619
aVActive international trade and low inflation, interest rates and unemployment are all signs of a healthy economy. Equally, if your personal finances are in good shape it's probably down to sound economic management. Whether it's planning for your future, managing public services, or running a multinational business, the allocation of resources between competing forces is a fine and constantly shifting balancing act with economics at its centre. Economics can be found under Social Sciences. http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/qualification/social-sciences/index.htm

aVCertezza delle regole per aiutare le infrastrutture\u000aLe criticità italiane analizzate dagli studiosi di Banca d'Italia, da Franco Bassanini e dal viceministro Ciaccia in un convegno Memit-Certet.\u000aIscriviti alla newsletter Bocconi http://info.unibocconi.it/newsletter/\u000a\u000aSe le infrastrutture sono "il carburante dell'economia", i provvedimenti che il governo sta prendendo serviranno a "mettere insieme i collegamenti con il resto d'Europa e a parlare con il mondo", ha affermato ieri il viceministro alle infrastrutture e trasporti, Mario Ciaccia, nel corso del convegno Le infrastrutture in Italia: dotazione, programmazione, realizzazione, organizzato da Certet e Memit in collaborazione con Banca d'Italia. Anche se non c'è accordo su come misurare il gap infrastrutturale italiano, il ministro si è detto convinto che servano almeno 100 miliardi di investimenti nei prossimi tre anni, con una maggiore attenzione alla qualità della spesa e con nuovi strumenti per finanziare i lavori. Oltre ai lavori sbloccati con gli ultimi provvedimenti, Ciaccia ha infatti rivendicato gli interventi che renderanno possibile l'utilizzo di project bond e obbligazioni di scopo, nonché il project financing per la costruzione di nuove carceri.\u000a\u000aUn punto critico, secondo il viceministro e gli altri partecipanti al convegno, rimane però la scarsa attrattività dell'Italia per gli investitori a lungo termine, come i fondi. "Senza la certezza di invarianza normativa", ha affermato Ciaccia, "si rimarrà sempre un paese a rischio".

VWorlds of English
p7655
aVHow has the English language spread internationally - and is the worldwide influence of English a cause for celebration or concern? How is it changing in response to social, cultural, and technological developments? 'Worlds of English' investigates these notions by looking at the expansion of English in China since the 1970s, how it is now the dominant language used at the European Parliament and how a local vernacular in Singapore, known as 'Singlish' is causing controversy. It also examines the role of, and attitude towards, English since the end of Apartheid. This material forms part of the Open University course U214 Worlds of English.

VWorlds of English
p8271
aVHow has the English language spread internationally - and is the worldwide influence of English a cause for celebration or concern? How is it changing in response to social, cultural, and technological developments? 'Worlds of English' investigates these notions by looking at the expansion of English in China since the 1970s, how it is now the dominant language used at the European Parliament and how a local vernacular in Singapore, known as 'Singlish' is causing controversy. It also examines the role of, and attitude towards, English since the end of Apartheid. This material forms part of the Open University course U214 Worlds of English.

aVCourse Description:\u000aChemistry 14D: Organic Reactions and Pharmaceuticals is a class that provides an in depth analysis of organic reactions, nucleophilic and electrophilic substitutions and additions; electrophilic aromatic substitutions, carbonyl reactions, catalysis, molecular basis of drug action, and organic chemistry of pharmaceuticals.\u000a\u000aAbout the Professor:\u000aProfessor Hardinger has been a faculty member in the UCLA Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry since 1997. His professional career began at Drexel University in Philadelphia, which afforded a BS in Chemistry in 1982. He then moved to Purdue University, and earned a PhD in Organic Chemistry in 1988. Two subsequent years as a postdoctoral scholar at Renssalear Polytechnic Institute were followed by appointment in 1990 as assistant professor at California State University. In 1997 he achieved the "forbidden transition" and moved to UCLA as Lecturer followed by promotion to Senior Lecturer in 2004. At UCLA his main teaching interests have been introductory organic chemistry courses in the physical science majors series as well as the life science majors series. His professional interests include development of new teaching tools and methods, both in print and electronic media. An introductory organic chemistry textbook (Organic Chemistry - A Thinking Student's Approach) is currently in development.\u000a\u000aCourse Webpage: http://www.chem.ucla.edu/harding/\u000a\u000aNote: Some clips and images may have been blurred or removed to avoid copyright infringement. \u000a\u000a* See all the UCLA Chemistry 14D: Organic Reactions and Pharmaceuticals classes in this series: http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=4BE4AAFBFECDB2F8\u000a* See more courses from UCLA: http://www.youtube.com/uclacourses\u000a* See more from UCLA's main channel on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/ucla

aVIntroduction to Linear Dynamical Systems (EE263) is the introduction to applied linear algebra and linear dynamical systems, with applications to circuits, signal processing, communications, and control systems. Topics include: Least-squares aproximations of over-determined equations and least-norm solutions of underdetermined equations. Symmetric matrices, matrix norm and singular value decomposition. Eigenvalues, left and right eigenvectors, and dynamical interpretation. Matrix exponential, stability, and asymptotic behavior. Multi-input multi-output systems, impulse and step matrices; convolution and transfer matrix descriptions. Control, reachability, state transfer, and least-norm inputs. Observability and least-squares state estimation. EE263 covers some of the same topics, but is complementary to, CME200.

p8574
aVInstructor: Klaus-Ju\u0308rgen Bathe\u000a\u000aThis video series is a comprehensive course of study that presents effective finite element procedures for the linear analysis of solids and structures. The finite element method is the ideal tool for solving static and dynamic problems in engineering and the sciences. Linear analysis assumes linear elastic behavior and infinitesimally small displacements and strains. To establish appropriate models for analysis, it is necessary to become familiar with the finite element methods available.\u000a\u000aView the complete course: http://ocw.mit.edu/RES2-002S10\u000a\u000aLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\u000aMore information at http://ocw.mit.edu/terms\u000aMore courses at http://ocw.mit.edu

p8812
aVTechnology has the capability to transform products and processes and can make a huge contribution to organisational performance and even to national well-being. The effective management of technology is essential if all the potential benefits for individuals and organisations are to be realised. Technology managers need to make complex decisions associated with identification and evaluation of technologies, developing new or improved products and processes and integrating technology with other business processes, and to manage change required by technology implementation. There is an increasing demand across public, private and not-for-profit sectors for people with the vision and the operational and strategic capability to plan, develop and manage technology effectively. 'Managing Technology' can be found under Engineering, Technology and Design. http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/qualification/engineering-technology-and-design/index.htm

It involves taking a technology idea and finding a high-potential commercial opportunity, gathering resources such as talent and capital, figuring out how to sell and market the idea, and managing rapid growth.\u000a\u000aThe class demonstrates the entrepreneurial mindset ... when others see insurmountable problems, people look for opportunities in technology and business solutions. A technology entrepreneurial perspective is also a wonderful way of thinking in order to tackle new opportunities in social entrepreneurship, whether it is in government or NGOs (non-profits).

VMIT 11.965 Reflective Practice, IAP 2007
p8865
aVView the complete course: http://ocw.mit.edu/11-965IAP07\u000aInstructor: Ceasar McDowell, Claudia Canepa, Sebastiao Ferriera\u000a\u000aThe course is an introduction to the approach of Reflective Practice developed by Donald Schön. It is an approach that enables professionals to understand how they use their knowledge in practical situations and how they can combine practice and learning in a more effective way. Through greater awareness of how they deploy their knowledge in practical situations, professionals can increase their capacities of learning in a more timely way. Understanding how they frame situations and ideas helps professionals to achieve greater flexibility and increase their capacity of conceptual innovation.\u000a\u000aThe objective of the course is to introduce students to the approach and methods of reflective practice by raising their awareness about their own cognitive resources and how they use them in their practice. The course will introduce theories of learning, knowledge generation, framing and reframing, theories of action, reflection-in-practice, and conceptual innovation, and provide students with opportunities to experiment with these theories in real life through practical exercises in which they reflect on real situations that they have faced in their past professional experience. Through these practical exercises, students will have the opportunity to reflect on their thinking capacities in the context of their practice.

aVThe Initiative in Innovative Computing (IIC) was proposed by a group of scientists from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Medical School at Harvard in response to the solicitation for ideas made by the Task Force on Science and Technology, chaired by Provost Steve Hyman, in 2004. A whitepaper was prepared, and in 2005 the Initiative was selected to go forward. The IIC's offices opened in spring 2006, and its first projects were selected that summer. Several of those projects continue at Harvard and at Massachusetts General Hospital as sponsored research. \u000a\u000aDuring its final year, 2009-10, the IIC's seminars and a subset of the projects were adopted by the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

VMIT 11.965 Reflective Practice, IAP 2007
p9143
aVView the complete course: http://ocw.mit.edu/11-965IAP07\u000aInstructor: Ceasar McDowell, Claudia Canepa, Sebastiao Ferriera\u000a\u000aThe course is an introduction to the approach of Reflective Practice developed by Donald Schön. It is an approach that enables professionals to understand how they use their knowledge in practical situations and how they can combine practice and learning in a more effective way. Through greater awareness of how they deploy their knowledge in practical situations, professionals can increase their capacities of learning in a more timely way. Understanding how they frame situations and ideas helps professionals to achieve greater flexibility and increase their capacity of conceptual innovation.\u000a\u000aThe objective of the course is to introduce students to the approach and methods of reflective practice by raising their awareness about their own cognitive resources and how they use them in their practice. The course will introduce theories of learning, knowledge generation, framing and reframing, theories of action, reflection-in-practice, and conceptual innovation, and provide students with opportunities to experiment with these theories in real life through practical exercises in which they reflect on real situations that they have faced in their past professional experience. Through these practical exercises, students will have the opportunity to reflect on their thinking capacities in the context of their practice.

aVCertezza delle regole per aiutare le infrastrutture\u000aLe criticità italiane analizzate dagli studiosi di Banca d'Italia, da Franco Bassanini e dal viceministro Ciaccia in un convegno Memit-Certet.\u000aIscriviti alla newsletter Bocconi http://info.unibocconi.it/newsletter/\u000a\u000aSe le infrastrutture sono "il carburante dell'economia", i provvedimenti che il governo sta prendendo serviranno a "mettere insieme i collegamenti con il resto d'Europa e a parlare con il mondo", ha affermato ieri il viceministro alle infrastrutture e trasporti, Mario Ciaccia, nel corso del convegno Le infrastrutture in Italia: dotazione, programmazione, realizzazione, organizzato da Certet e Memit in collaborazione con Banca d'Italia. Anche se non c'è accordo su come misurare il gap infrastrutturale italiano, il ministro si è detto convinto che servano almeno 100 miliardi di investimenti nei prossimi tre anni, con una maggiore attenzione alla qualità della spesa e con nuovi strumenti per finanziare i lavori. Oltre ai lavori sbloccati con gli ultimi provvedimenti, Ciaccia ha infatti rivendicato gli interventi che renderanno possibile l'utilizzo di project bond e obbligazioni di scopo, nonché il project financing per la costruzione di nuove carceri.\u000a\u000aUn punto critico, secondo il viceministro e gli altri partecipanti al convegno, rimane però la scarsa attrattività dell'Italia per gli investitori a lungo termine, come i fondi. "Senza la certezza di invarianza normativa", ha affermato Ciaccia, "si rimarrà sempre un paese a rischio".

VHistory - The Wollaton Library Collection
p9439
aVThe medieval manuscripts from Wollaton Hall library represent a rare and significant corpus of medieval textual and material artefacts. Their generally frail physical condition adds interest, retaining evidence of their original creation.\u000a\u000aThe manuscripts once formed part of an extensive private library at Wollaton Hall, Nottinghamshire, belonging to the Willoughby family. The dispersal of the Wollaton Hall library began with a major sale in 1925, and items originally in the Library can now be found in many different institutions and private collections.\u000a\u000aThe continuity of ownership and known archival context for these manuscripts gives them particular regional significance, and provides exciting evidence for the study of patronage, readership and provincial culture. Despite their significance, the manuscripts remained little known, but recent detailed work on the volumes and their history had revealed a wealth of new information. This is now being prepared for publication.\u000a\u000aThe literary, historical and cultural importance of the collection was noted by Stevenson in his Report on the Manuscripts of Lord Middleton (HMC, 1911). As a group, their significance was publicised locally in the University of Nottingham exhibition Image and Text (1996).\u000a\u000aThe Wollaton Library Collection was a discrete element of a family archive (the Middleton Collection) which has been curated by the University of Nottingham since 1947. In 2007 the medieval manuscripts were purchased by the University with assistance from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF).

This is the utmost reflection of the dramatic stage that brain research has reached at the start of the 21st century. The connected parts of the puzzle reveal a bright and colorful picture: molecular, anatomical and optical techniques have allowed us to become intimately acquainted with the processes underlying learning and memory in the brain. Furthermore, sophisticated mathematical methods and huge computational power have accelerated our capability to build artificial brains. We can now explore how the physical constituents of the brain give rise to perception, action, consciousness, and feelings like the joy of music. This emergent understanding has far-reaching technological, clinical and social implications.\u000a\u000aThe thread of thought in this course, accessible to any interested person, will start by describing the building blocks of this amazing machine and will continue with an overview regarding the neurobiological basis of learning and memory. The course will describe new methods for an optical voyage into the behaving brain and will touch on ways to repair the sick brain using brain-machine interfaces. The course will end with a discussion about the biological basis for aesthetic feelings and consciousness. This meeting of the brain-kind will also include two discussions with brain researchers: one on the question of Are we free to choose? and the other on the question of Can the brain understand itself?

VCapitalism: Success, Crisis and Reform with Douglas W. Rae
p9537
aVIn this course, we will seek to interpret capitalism using ideas from biological evolution: Firms pursuing varied strategies and facing extinction when those strategies fail are analogous to organisms struggling for survival in nature. For this reason, it is less concerned with ultimate judgment of capitalism than with the ways it can be shaped to fit our more specific objectives -- for the natural environment, public health, alleviation of poverty, and development of human potential in every child. Each book we read will be explicitly or implicitly an argument about good and bad consequences of capitalism.

aVDr. John Coe.\u000a\u000aIntroductory study of the nature of spiritual theology and formation, which attempts to understand the nature of new life in Christ, the process of formation in the Spirit and the directives for cooperating with His work. Attention is given to the implications of Spiritual Theology for seminary training and classroom experience. Particular attention is given to understanding the implications of life in Christ regarding guilt, shame and legalism as well as the New Covenant ministry of the Spirit in transforming the heart in light of the dynamics of original sin, early relational development and the habits of sin developed over time. Attention is also given to developmental spirituality, how the Spirit transforms the heart over time and how this affects ministries of teaching, preaching and discipleship in the church.

VWorlds of English
p10289
aVHow has the English language spread internationally - and is the worldwide influence of English a cause for celebration or concern? How is it changing in response to social, cultural, and technological developments? 'Worlds of English' investigates these notions by looking at the expansion of English in China since the 1970s, how it is now the dominant language used at the European Parliament and how a local vernacular in Singapore, known as 'Singlish' is causing controversy. It also examines the role of, and attitude towards, English since the end of Apartheid. This material forms part of the Open University course U214 Worlds of English.

A whitepaper was prepared, and in 2005 the Initiative was selected to go forward. The IIC's offices opened in spring 2006, and its first projects were selected that summer. Several of those projects continue at Harvard and at Massachusetts General Hospital as sponsored research. \u000a\u000aDuring its final year, 2009-10, the IIC's seminars and a subset of the projects were adopted by the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

VGuitar Scales 101 with Larry Baione
p10721
aVScale study is a fundamental building block to guitar mastery. Accomplished guitarists use scales to add color, mood, depth and feeling to their playing. When you hear an amazing solo by Frank Zappa or Robert Fripp, you can be sure that these players are directly referencing their extensive knowledge and internalization of scales. Guitar Scales 101 will help you to organize the often-ambiguous guitar fretboard, and provide you with the knowledge to confidently navigate the instrument and develop your technique. The course begins by looking at the major and pentatonic scales, and how these scales work at different points up the neck. You'll then learn to construct and play blues, Dorian, and Mixolydian scales in all keys, and apply these scales to performance-based weekly musical examples and practice exercises. In addition, you will be studying the harmonic minor and melodic minor scales and modes. With weekly assignments that you can record and upload to your professor for review, you'll greatly improve your single-line technique, and gain a firm understanding of the possibilities available within the guitar's fretboard.

VGuitar Chords 101 and 201 with Rick Peckham
p10726
aVGuitar Chords 101 presents Berklee's approach to the construction of chords, a method that focuses less on the shape of an individual chord, and more on the notes that the chord is based around. Students will learn to construct and play triads and basic 7th chords, as well as look at inversions and different chord voicings -- the basic foundations guitarists use to write or perform in any number of different styles.\u000a\u000aBuilding on the foundation of Guitar Chords 101, Guitar Chords 201 is the next level in Berklee's world-famous approach to guitar study, one in which players focus on the individual notes that make up a chord, rather than on the chord's shape. Guitar Chords 201 provides essential technical training that will improve your style, intonation, technique, time feel, and tone.

VBlues Guitar with Michael Williams
p10780
aVGuitarists who know the blues have a natural advantage over those that don't. No matter what style they chose to play -- jazz, rock, classical -- having a blues background provides guitarists with a foundation in form, control, feel and harmonies that can be used to advance their playing in any genre of music. Blues Guitar Workshop begins by teaching the 12-bar blues harmony, basic rhythm guitar technique, and the pentatonic and blues scale in the open position up the neck. You'll learn to incorporate some of the nuances of the masters into your playing - from doubling the bass over a shuffle in the style of Buddy Guy, to combining major and minor pentatonic scales in the style of B.B. King and T-Bone Walker. Through call and response exercises and playing in other grooves and tempos, you'll learn to pace your solos to create tension and release -- a technique mastered by all the greatest guitarists. You'll learn to reuse the concepts and musical elements to expand your musical foundation and enhance your ability, whether you're trying to bring a blues sound to your playing or adding more depth and feel to any other style.

Starting with the history of the ways in which the West has discovered, translated and written about the Orient, we will consider how power and politics play roles in the production of culture, narrative and performance. This approach assumes that performance, verbal art, and oral literature lend themselves to spontaneous adaptation and to oblique expression of ideas and opinions whose utterance would otherwise be censorable or disruptive. In particular we will be concerned with the way traditional performance practices are affected by and respond to the consequences of modernization.\u000a\u000aTopics include oral epic performance, sacred narrative, Koranic chant performance, the folktale, solo performance, cultural production and resistance.\u000a\u000aLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\u000aMore information at http://ocw.mit.edu/terms\u000aMore courses at http://ocw.mit.edu

p11641
aVHow has the English language spread internationally - and is the worldwide influence of English a cause for celebration or concern? How is it changing in response to social, cultural, and technological developments? 'Worlds of English' investigates these notions by looking at the expansion of English in China since the 1970s, how it is now the dominant language used at the European Parliament and how a local vernacular in Singapore, known as 'Singlish' is causing controversy. It also examines the role of, and attitude towards, English since the end of Apartheid. This material forms part of the Open University course U214 Worlds of English.

p11703
aVANN supports a variety of efforts designed to develop social network theory. One key strategy to developing new theory is the exploration of information-based communication networks that are the foundation of a new social form called the network society. Another useful approach takes the form of exploring multiple existing social theories to identify new implications for social networks that accrue from combining multiple theories at multiple levels. A third technique is to apply a theory developed to explain other phenomena to information and communication networks, as in the case of evolutionary theory. ANN also undertakes empirical research projects to test these network theories.\u000a\u000aANN sponsors advanced workshops focused on network theory development as well as a seminar series featuring distinguished network scholars from around the world. Initial financial support for ANN has been provided by the Annenberg School for Communication and the Annenberg Center for Communication, USC. ANN has also received generous technological research assistance from Google, Inc.

aVFractures, Alliances and Mobilizations in the Age of Obama: Emerging Analyses of the 'Tea Party Movement'\u000a\u000aThis conference will bring together leading scholars, along with several journalists and political commentators, to discuss and debate the emergence and implications of the "Tea Party Movement" in the wake of Obama's election.  Much has been made of the Tea Party Movement in the media however there is little, if any, scholarship on it. This conference, which features historians, political scientists, sociologists, and race and gender scholars, is intended to begin to fill this gap.\u000a\u000aKey questions that the conference will address include: Is the "Tea Party Movement" (TPM) a new social movement, an emerging political party, a media-driven construction, or something else?  What are the origins, ideology, and constituencies of the TPM and how were they formed? What is the relationship between the TPM and the Right, especially the GOP and the Christian Right, in the U.S., and what role will the TPM play in shaping the 2010 and future elections?  How do race, class and gender factor into the TPM's message and membership?  How are TPM activists tapping into and/or managing the populist, libertarian, and radical currents on the Right, as well as fear, anger and resentment among segments of the American public?  What significance does the TPM hold for the future of American politics?\u000a\u000aCo-sponsored by the Institute for the Study of Societal Issues, the Institute of Governmental Studies, the Charles and Louise Travers Department of Political Science, the Sociology Department, the Gender and Women's Studies Department, the Haas Diversity Research Center, the Townsend Center for Humanities, the Center for Race and Gender, the Center for the Study of Social Change, the American Cultures Center, and the Berkeley Undergraduate Political Science Association.\u000a\u000aSponsor:Arts & Humanities

p12555
aVThe objective of this subject is to understand the nature of manufacturing process variation and the methods for its control. First, a general process model for control is developed to understand the limitations a specific process places on the type of control used. A general model for process variation is presented and three methods are developed to minimize variations: Statistical Process Control, Process Optimization and in-process Feedback Control. These are considered in a hierarchy of cost-performance tradeoffs, where performance is based on changes in process capability. This course was also taught as part of the Singapore-MIT Alliance (SMA) programme as course number SMA 6306 (Manufacturing Physics III: Process Optimization and Control).\u000a\u000aView the complete course: http://ocw.mit.edu/2-830JS08\u000a\u000aLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA \u000aMore information at http://ocw.mit.edu/terms \u000aMore courses at http://ocw.mit.edu

VMathematics - Functional Analysis
p12684
aVFunctional analysis begins with a marriage of linear algebra and metric topology. These work together in a highly effective way to elucidate problems arising from differential equations. Solutions are sought in an infinite dimensional space of functions. This module paves the way by establishing the principal theorems (all due in part to the great Polish mathematician Stefan Banach) and exploring their diverse consequences. \u000a\u000aTopics to be covered will include: -- norm topology and topological isomorphism; -- boundedness of operators; -- compactness and finite dimensionality; -- extension of functionals; -- weak*-compactness; -- sequence spaces and duality; -- basic properties of Banach algebras. \u000a\u000aDr Joel Feinstein is an Associate Professor in Pure Mathematics at the University of Nottingham. After reading mathematics at Cambridge, he carried out research for his doctorate at Leeds. He held a postdoctoral position in Leeds for one year, and then spent two years as a lecturer at Maynooth (Ireland) before taking up a permanent position at Nottingham. His main research interest is in functional analysis, especially commutative Banach algebras. Dr Feinstein has published two case studies on his use of IT in the teaching of mathematics to undergraduates. In 2009, Dr Feinstein was awarded a University of Nottingham Lord Dearing teaching award for his popular and successful innovations in this area.\u000a\u000aAdditional materials for this module are available at: http://unow.nottingham.ac.uk/resources/resource.aspx?hid=bd32d53b-3c12-ac19-176b-d9e112731951 and http://itunesu.nottingham.ac.uk/albums/64.rss.

aVThe Social Enterprise internship Programme, devised and led by Community Partnerships, was a year long pilot (from January 2011 to Jan 2012) offering a universally recognised  internship/placement opportunity to students, but with the added dimension of a targeted or thematic sector offer with social businesses - specifically Social Enterprises and the Third Sector (not for profit).  The  programme has been a clear demonstration of what the University can achieve through targeted 'public engagement', where the public is defined as: 'Third sector/civil society organisations and social enterprises, as a route to disadvantaged and harder to reach communities'. \u000aThe Programme has also initiated an excellent opportunity for researchers to work further with organisations (both through the pilot Social Enterprise programme and through new contacts) towards higher levels of research, which will have national and potentially international impact. The post graduate fraternity involved have gained considerably in terms of their own employability skills and it has provided an important contact point with the third sector and an opportunity to apply research skills in a 'real life' setting.

VThe Victorians: Empire and Race
p12716
aVScience and religion came together to help shape the attitudes of the British and Europeans towards the rest of the world, whose inhabitants were increasingly regarded as socially inferior and spiritually ignorant.\u000aThis lecture looks at how these ideas framed the growth of overseas Empire in the latter part of the nineteenth century, how Britain and those European states that possessed colonies governed them and what were the consequences for politics and ideology at home, above all in the growth of the Social Darwinism, racism and extreme nationalism that led to the end of the 'Victorian' era in the First World War.\u000a\u000aThe lecture can be download for free from the Gresham College website:\u000ahttp://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/the-victorians-empire-and-race

VDeath with Shelly Kagan
p12747
aVThere is one thing I can be sure of: I am going to die. But what am I to make of that fact? This course will examine a number of issues that arise once we begin to reflect on our mortality. The possibility that death may not actually be the end is considered. Are we, in some sense, immortal? Would immortality be desirable? Also a clearer notion of what it is to die is examined. What does it mean to say that a person has died? What kind of fact is that? And, finally, different attitudes to death are evaluated. Is death an evil? How? Why? Is suicide morally permissible? Is it rational? How should the knowledge that I am going to die affect the way I live my life?

aVWater is the lifeblood of California. Without it, the landscape we know today would not exist. Throughout Californias history, water has been a source of food, commerce, energy, and recreation. It makes possible the bountiful Central Valley farms and the vibrant coastal cities. It has inspired countless poets and painters. Californians have simultaneously fought over water, marveled at its beauty, and - through impressive feats of engineering - moved it hundreds of miles.\u000a\u000aThe popular lecture series, the California Colloquium on Water, continues. Scholars of distinction in the fields of natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, humanities, law and environmental design will offer monthly lectures. These lectures are designed to increase the understanding and appreciation among students, faculty and the general public of water resources and to contribute to informed decisions about water in California. \u000a\u000aThe Water Resources Center Archives (WRCA) collects, preserves and provides access to historical and contemporary water-related materials that support the instructional and research programs of the University of California and the needs of the people of the State.\u000a\u000aFor schedules and information, visit: http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/WRCA/\u000a\u000aSponsor:Water Resources Center Archives

aVThe UC Berkeley College of Environmental Design (CED) marks its 50th anniversary with a series of events planned both to pay tribute to CEDs history and legacy, and to engage the college community in a lively discussion about its future. The year long events begin with a tribute to CEDs traditions of design activism at the symposium Traditions of Design Activism on September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2009. And then continues in the spring with the college focusing on the issues important  to the future of the design and planning fields at the colloquium Visualizing the Future of Environmental Design (February 3-6 2010).\u000a\u000ahttp://www.ced.berkeley.edu\u000a\u000aSponsor:College of Environmental Design

VEnvironmental Politics and Law with John Wargo
p13141
aVCan law change human behavior to be less environmentally damaging? Law will be examined through case histories including: environmental effects of national security, pesticides, air pollution, consumer products, plastics, parks and protected area management, land use, urban growth and sprawl, public/private transit, drinking water standards, food safety, and hazardous site restoration. In each case we will review the structure of law and evaluate its strengths and weaknesses.

VCourse | Virology (Biology)
p13567
aVThe basic thesis of the course is that all viruses adopt a common strategy. The strategy is simple:\u000a\u000a1. Viral genomes are contained in metastable particles.\u000a\u000a2. Genomes encode gene products that promote an infectious cycle (mechanisms for genomes to enter cells, replicate, and exit in particles).\u000a\u000a3. Infection patterns range from benign to lethal; infections can overcome or co-exist with host defenses.\u000a\u000aThe course will emphasize the common reactions that must be completed by all viruses for successful reproduction within a host cell and survival and spread within a host population. The molecular basis of alternative reproductive cycles, the interactions of viruses with host organisms, and how these lead to disease are presented with examples drawn from a set of representative animal and human viruses, although selected bacterial viruses will be discussed.

VMIT Understanding Lasers and Fiberoptics
p13624
aVLasers are essential to an incredibly large number of applications. Today, they are used in bar code readers, compact discs, medicine, communications, sensors, materials processing, computer printers, data processing, 3D-imaging, spectroscopy, navigation, non-destructive testing, chemical processing, color copiers, laser "shows", and in the military. There is hardly a field untouched by the laser. But what exactly is so unique about lasers that makes them so effective?\u000a\u000aThis brief video course is designed for engineers, scientists, medical personnel, managers, and others who work with lasers and/or fiberoptics, or who anticipate working with lasers and/or fiberoptics, yet have little or no background in laser or fiberoptic basics. The course focuses on fundamentals and emphasizes a physical intuitive interpretation of laser and fiberoptic phenomena and their applications. Because Prof. Ezekiel keeps mathematics to a minimum, the topics covered are easily understood, without the need for a strong technical background. Prof. Ezekiel uses plain language, graphic illustrations, and video demonstrations to explain the basic characteristics of lasers and fiberoptics.

p13641
aVThis course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe--a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place-- became the motor of globalization and a world civilzation in its own right. Put differently how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern".

VEuropean Civiliization (1648-1945) with John Merriman
p13646
aVThis course offers a broad survey of modern European history, from the end of the Thirty Years' War to the aftermath of World War II. Along with the consideration of major events and figures such as the French Revolution and Napoleon, attention will be paid to the experience of ordinary people in times of upheaval and transition. The period will thus be viewed neither in terms of historical inevitability nor as a procession of great men, but rather through the lens of the complex interrelations between demographic change, political revolution, and cultural development. Textbook accounts will be accompanied by the study of exemplary works of art, literature, and cinema.

V- Managing Technology
p13677
aVTechnology has the capability to transform products and processes and can make a huge contribution to organisational performance and even to national well-being. The effective management of technology is essential if all the potential benefits for individuals and organisations are to be realised. Technology managers need to make complex decisions associated with identification and evaluation of technologies, developing new or improved products and processes and integrating technology with other business processes, and to manage change required by technology implementation. There is an increasing demand across public, private and not-for-profit sectors for people with the vision and the operational and strategic capability to plan, develop and manage technology effectively. 'Managing Technology' can be found under Engineering, Technology and Design. http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/qualification/engineering-technology-and-design/index.htm

VConference on Ambiguity, Uncertainty and Climate Change
p14174
aVDAY 1 SESSIONS - SEPTEMBER 17, 2009\u000a\u000aOver the past decade, there has been considerable progress in the economic theory of ambiguity and ambiguity aversion, involving decisions where the decision maker does not know, or is uncertain about, the probabilities attached to various potential outcomes. This is an appropriate characterization of the current understanding of many facets of climate change science: the uncertainty is pervasive and profound, with many unknowns, and unknown unknowns, that cannot be characterized in terms of a conventional probability distribution. The conference explores the application of developments in the economic theory of ambiguity to climate change policy, including both mitigation policy (the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation policy (coping with the consequences of climate change). Some, but not all, of the fog of uncertainty will gradually dissipate over time, but meanwhile policy decisions have to be made now, whether for mitigation or adaptation. Climate change policy analysis needs to reflect not only the prevailing uncertainty and ambiguity, but also the anticipated future resolution of uncertainty and ambiguity. The challenge is to incorporate risk and risk aversion, ambiguity and ambiguity aversion, and learning, more adequately into the formulation of a framework for decision making on climate change policy. This is the central focus of the conference.\u000a\u000aTo explore this issue, the conference brings some leading researchers on the economic theory of uncertainty and ambiguity and the economics of climate change together with some leading climate scientists and modelers. Some of the invitees have been asked to make formal presentations or provide formal comments; others invitees are expected to contribute to the discussion from the floor.\u000a\u000aThe conference was held on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley on September 17- 18, 2009.\u000a\u000ahttp://calclimate.wordpress.com\u000a\u000aSponsor:Climate and Energy Policy Institute

Along with the consideration of major events and figures such as the French Revolution and Napoleon, attention will be paid to the experience of ordinary people in times of upheaval and transition. The period will thus be viewed neither in terms of historical inevitability nor as a procession of great men, but rather through the lens of the complex interrelations between demographic change, political revolution, and cultural development. Textbook accounts will be accompanied by the study of exemplary works of art, literature, and cinema.

Voiced by Clive Anderson, this entertaining romp through 'The History of English' squeezes 1600 years of history into 10 one-minute bites, uncovering the sources of English words and phrases from Shakespeare and the King James Bible to America and the Internet.  Bursting with fascinating facts, the series looks at how English grew from a small tongue into a major global language before reflecting on the future of English in the 21st century.

VArt History of Games
p14451
aVGames, a creative form "older than culture," have served humanity in such diverse ways as entertainment, education, exercise, conflict resolution, ritual and self-expression. But not until the 20th century did games and the play experiences they provide start to be perceived as an art form as well. With nods to the past and future, and with an open acknowledgment of all the awkwardness, bravado and measured successes thus far, The Art History of Games seeks to more clearly articulate the importance of games as a form of art.\u000a\u000aThe Art History of Games was a three-day public symposium organized by Georgia Tech Digital Media and SCAD Atlanta, where members of the fields of game studies, art history and related areas of cultural studies gathered to investigate games as an art form. Leading game theorists and historians from around the world gathered in the High Museum of Art's Rich Auditorium on the campus of the Woodruff Arts Center, in midtown Atlanta in February 2010.

aVCrime and how to control crime are issues that both fascinate us and make us fearful. From the actions of petty thieves to the threats of terrorist organisations, crime affects us all to a lesser or greater extent. But why are some actions defined as criminal or anti-social, while others are not? And who defines them? Criminology attempts to answer these questions. It can be found under Social Sciences. http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/qualification/social-sciences/index.htm

p14603
aVView the complete course: http://ocw.mit.edu/11-965IAP07\u000aInstructor: Ceasar McDowell, Claudia Canepa, Sebastiao Ferriera\u000a\u000aThe course is an introduction to the approach of Reflective Practice developed by Donald Schön. It is an approach that enables professionals to understand how they use their knowledge in practical situations and how they can combine practice and learning in a more effective way. Through greater awareness of how they deploy their knowledge in practical situations, professionals can increase their capacities of learning in a more timely way. Understanding how they frame situations and ideas helps professionals to achieve greater flexibility and increase their capacity of conceptual innovation.\u000a\u000aThe objective of the course is to introduce students to the approach and methods of reflective practice by raising their awareness about their own cognitive resources and how they use them in their practice. The course will introduce theories of learning, knowledge generation, framing and reframing, theories of action, reflection-in-practice, and conceptual innovation, and provide students with opportunities to experiment with these theories in real life through practical exercises in which they reflect on real situations that they have faced in their past professional experience. Through these practical exercises, students will have the opportunity to reflect on their thinking capacities in the context of their practice.

VAlan Turing Centenary Lectures
p15182
aV2012 marks the centenary of the birth of Alan Turing, an event being celebrated worldwide. Turing is regarded by many as the originator of modern computing. His work had a strong influence in several fields: mathematics, logic, cryptology and morphogenesis, but it is perhaps in the field of computer science that his legacy has been the most profound. The University of Edinburgh and the Royal Society of Edinburgh present a series of lectures celebrating his achievements and reflecting on the impact of his work on modern life.

This collection of video animations and audio discussions examines how the heroes of Greek mythology have been represented in popular culture, from ancient times to the modern day. Odysseus is the archetypal questing hero - a blank canvas on which every era has projected its own values. Heracles is the original strongman. And Achilles is the fighter whose sexuality vies with his heel for popular attention. The videos mix archive film and TV clips with character animation, bringing a playful approach to classical myth,

VHistory - The Wollaton Library Collection
p15334
aVThe medieval manuscripts from Wollaton Hall library represent a rare and significant corpus of medieval textual and material artefacts. Their generally frail physical condition adds interest, retaining evidence of their original creation.\u000a\u000aThe manuscripts once formed part of an extensive private library at Wollaton Hall, Nottinghamshire, belonging to the Willoughby family. The dispersal of the Wollaton Hall library began with a major sale in 1925, and items originally in the Library can now be found in many different institutions and private collections.\u000a\u000aThe continuity of ownership and known archival context for these manuscripts gives them particular regional significance, and provides exciting evidence for the study of patronage, readership and provincial culture. Despite their significance, the manuscripts remained little known, but recent detailed work on the volumes and their history had revealed a wealth of new information. This is now being prepared for publication.\u000a\u000aThe literary, historical and cultural importance of the collection was noted by Stevenson in his Report on the Manuscripts of Lord Middleton (HMC, 1911). As a group, their significance was publicised locally in the University of Nottingham exhibition Image and Text (1996).\u000a\u000aThe Wollaton Library Collection was a discrete element of a family archive (the Middleton Collection) which has been curated by the University of Nottingham since 1947. In 2007 the medieval manuscripts were purchased by the University with assistance from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF).

Anche se non c'è accordo su come misurare il gap infrastrutturale italiano, il ministro si è detto convinto che servano almeno 100 miliardi di investimenti nei prossimi tre anni, con una maggiore attenzione alla qualità della spesa e con nuovi strumenti per finanziare i lavori. Oltre ai lavori sbloccati con gli ultimi provvedimenti, Ciaccia ha infatti rivendicato gli interventi che renderanno possibile l'utilizzo di project bond e obbligazioni di scopo, nonché il project financing per la costruzione di nuove carceri.\u000a\u000aUn punto critico, secondo il viceministro e gli altri partecipanti al convegno, rimane però la scarsa attrattività dell'Italia per gli investitori a lungo termine, come i fondi. "Senza la certezza di invarianza normativa", ha affermato Ciaccia, "si rimarrà sempre un paese a rischio".

aVCrime and how to control crime are issues that both fascinate us and make us fearful. From the actions of petty thieves to the threats of terrorist organisations, crime affects us all to a lesser or greater extent. But why are some actions defined as criminal or anti-social, while others are not? And who defines them? Criminology attempts to answer these questions.

p15816
aVCare of older people, lone motherhood, education, poverty and unemployment are among a long list of matters of national concern. Setting social policy is all about how we as a society decide who receives support, what form it takes, and who delivers it to the individuals who are thought to be vulnerable and in need. Should it be the state that delivers support? Or the market, charities or families? 'Social Policy' explores a variety of issues that are defined as social problems, and looks at how governments tackle them.

V508: prof. dr. Hugh Wilmott
p15975
aVDe lezing van Hugh Wilmot maakt deel uit van een serie van drie over het onderwerp wat voor kennis vergaart men door het doen van wetenschappelijk onderzoek. Wilmot presenteert een postmodernistische kijk op kennisvergaring. Hij stelt vragen als: kun je d.m.v. onderzoek streven naar d? waarheid, is er niet eerder sprake van een verzameling van lokale waarheden, wat is de waarde van de informatie die je verzamelt. Wilmott geeft ter illustratie het volgende voorbeeld. Als ik jou een interview afneem, dan ga ik ervan uit dat jij mij vertelt  hoe dingen gegaan zijn. Maar is dat wel zo? Want soms vertel je misschien heel bewust maar een verhaal dat ik graag zou horen. En jij vertelt jouw interpretatie van de gebeurtenissen en iemand anders zou een andere interpretatie van dezelfde gebeurtenissen kunnen geven. Als onderzoeker maak je van deze verhalen vaak zelf weer een verhaal. Maar wat maakt jouw verhaal waardevoller dan al die afzonderlijke verhalen waar jij uit geput hebt? Wat is kennis dan? Is wat jij vertelt kennis? Zijn die afzonderlijke verhalen kennis? Is het allemaal kennis? En wat zegt dat eventueel over een werkelijkheid die daarbuiten ligt, als hij er al ligt. Wilmot constateert raakvlakken met het constructivisme debat. Hij isoleert een aantal stromingen in de literatuur daarover, geeft daar voorbeelden bij, geeft ook aan wat hem zelf aanspreekt en hij eindigt met: luister, de onderzoeker is niet objectief. De onderzoeker zit daar ook in met zijn eigen gedachten en zijn eigen normen en waarden. Al die objectieviteitsclaims, ik heb het daar niet zo op.

p15984
aVDe lezing van Arjo Klamer maakt deel uit van een serie van drie over het onderwerp wat voor kennis vergaart men door het doen van wetenschappelijk onderzoek. Klamer maakt zijn standpunt als volgt duidelijk. Iemand ziet iets, duidt het en vertelt dat aan een iemand anders. Deze op zijn beurt interpreteert wat hem verteld wordt, ook weer en schrijft dat op. Stel er zou een werkelijkheid en waarheid bestaan, hoe verhoudt zich datgene wat hij opschrijft zich tot die werkelijkheid? Volgens Klamer, kun je daar  eigenlijk nooit achter komen. Het enige wat je kunt is je daar bewust van zijn en daar op een gepaste  manier mee omgaan in je onderzoek.  Voor de meeste onderzoekers betekent dat je als onderzoeker bescheidener opstellen, proberen je bewust te zijn van de stappen die hebben geleid tot jouw interpretatie zonder de pretentie te hebben daar ooit volledig in te kunnen zijn.  Dat is immers niet mogelijk, want een heleboel dingen doe je gewoon onbewust, interpreteer je onbewust. Klamer vraagt onderzoekers zich hiervan bewust te zijn en ernaar te handelen.

Vragen die hij daarbij aan de orde stelt,  zijn: Wat houdt dat in, wat kunnen we er mee en wat niet. Chapman vergelijkt kwalitatief onderzoek met kwantitatief onderzoek en komt tot de slotsom dat de ene aanpak niet beter is dan de andere. Voor beide geldt dat ze bruikbaar zijn voor bepaalde doelen en voor andere niet. Als je al een voorkeur hebt, moet je bereid zijn die met een kritische blik te beschouwen en zo nodig ter discussie te stellen, zo vindt Chapman

p16207
aVCourse Description:\u000aGerman 59: Holocaust in Film and Literature is a course that provides insight into the History of Holocaust and its present memory through examination of challenges and problems encountered in trying to imagine its horror through media of literature and film.\u000a\u000aAbout the Professor:\u000aTodd Presner is Associate Professor of Germanic Languages, Comparative Literature, and Jewish Studies. His research focuses on German-Jewish intellectual and cultural history, the history of media, visual culture, digital humanities, and cultural geography.

aVLectures, recitations, and demonstrations covering topics related to differential equations.\u000a\u000aDifferential equations are the language in which the laws of nature are expressed. Understanding properties of solutions of differential equations is fundamental to much of contemporary science and engineering. Ordinary differential equations (ODE's) deal with functions of one variable, which can often be thought of as time. Topics include: Solution of first-order ODE's by analytical, graphical and numerical methods; Linear ODE's, especially second order with constant coefficients; Undetermined coefficients and variation of parameters; Sinusoidal and exponential signals: oscillations, damping, resonance; Complex numbers and exponentials; Fourier series, periodic solutions; Delta functions, convolution, and Laplace transform methods; Matrix and first order linear systems: eigenvalues and eigenvectors; and Non-linear autonomous systems: critical point analysis and phase plane diagrams. \u000a\u000aView the complete course: http://ocw.mit.edu/18-03SCF11\u000a\u000aLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\u000aMore information at http://ocw.mit.edu/terms\u000aMore courses at http://ocw.mit.edu

aVHow does the law stand in relation to web privacy? Do we have the same rights online as we do in life? The online revolution has moved rapidly but has the law managed to keep up with it and what has been the impact on our legal rights. These two films touch upon issues that have emerged as a result of a growing online community. This collection explores the complications that arise when attempting to reconcile how various countries use different laws to police an individual's omnipresent profile on the net as well as discussing who owns the information we publish when we create an online account.

This collection of video animations and audio discussions examines how the heroes of Greek mythology have been represented in popular culture, from ancient times to the modern day. Odysseus is the archetypal questing hero - a blank canvas on which every era has projected its own values. Heracles is the original strongman. And Achilles is the fighter whose sexuality vies with his heel for popular attention. The videos mix archive film and TV clips with character animation, bringing a playful approach to classical myth,

CGT recognizes that many of the worlds problems, such as poverty, inequality and governance, fall increasingly in the spaces between academic disciplines. With that truth in mind, President Lee Bollinger appointed Columbia University's most distinguished faculty to the Committee, from departments including Anthropology, Law, Political Science, Sociology and Economics to explore these gaps.\u000a\u000aChaired by Nobel Laureate University Professor Joseph Stiglitz, the professors who make up the Committee are among the most prestigious scholars in their fields.  CGTs initial aim is to identify underrepresented viewpoints that link disciplines. In so doing, CGT will augment the Universitys engagement with issues of globalization.

V- General Law
p17686
aVLaw is a fascinating subject, with a great tradition and a dynamic future. It's a foundation stone of society and plays an increasingly important and visible role in virtually all areas of modern life. Social and environmental responsibilities, business operations and international codes of conduct are all determined and upheld by legal systems. 'General Law' can be found under Law. http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/qualification/law/index.htm

p17691
aVHow does the law stand in relation to web privacy? Do we have the same rights online as we do in life? The online revolution has moved rapidly but has the law managed to keep up with it and what has been the impact on our legal rights. These two films touch upon issues that have emerged as a result of a growing online community. This collection explores the complications that arise when attempting to reconcile how various countries use different laws to police an individual's omnipresent profile on the net as well as discussing who owns the information we publish when we create an online account.

For more information about the lab, see\u000ahere: http://tonyjack.org\u000a\u000aThe clips presented here are a draft (pre-publication) edit of an instructional video which describes how to conduct a study which relates neural measures to a wide variety of performance measures. This study is focused on two broad cognitive domains: socio-emotional cognition and non-social reasoning. The neural measures used employ magnetic resonance imaging to assess structure, resting connectivity, and functional activation while engaged in social and scientific reasoning tasks. The performance measures include a variety of problem solving tasks, attention tasks, self-report and peer-report measures. The viewer is taken through a description of the motivation for the study, and then a description of the steps involved in conducting the study.

VCourse | Virology (Biology)
p18037
aVThe basic thesis of the course is that all viruses adopt a common strategy. The strategy is simple:\u000a\u000a1. Viral genomes are contained in metastable particles.\u000a\u000a2. Genomes encode gene products that promote an infectious cycle (mechanisms for genomes to enter cells, replicate, and exit in particles).\u000a\u000a3. Infection patterns range from benign to lethal; infections can overcome or co-exist with host defenses.\u000a\u000aThe course will emphasize the common reactions that must be completed by all viruses for successful reproduction within a host cell and survival and spread within a host population. The molecular basis of alternative reproductive cycles, the interactions of viruses with host organisms, and how these lead to disease are presented with examples drawn from a set of representative animal and human viruses, although selected bacterial viruses will be discussed.

aVCourse Description:\u000aGerman 59: Holocaust in Film and Literature is a course that provides insight into the History of Holocaust and its present memory through examination of challenges and problems encountered in trying to imagine its horror through media of literature and film.\u000a\u000aAbout the Professor:\u000aTodd Presner is Associate Professor of Germanic Languages, Comparative Literature, and Jewish Studies. His research focuses on German-Jewish intellectual and cultural history, the history of media, visual culture, digital humanities, and cultural geography. He is the author of two books: The first, Mobile Modernity: Germans, Jews, Trains (Columbia University Press, 2007), maps German-Jewish intellectual history onto the development of the railway system; the second, Muscular Judaism: The Jewish Body and the Politics of Regeneration (Routledge, 2007), analyzes the aesthetic dimensions of the strong Jewish body.\u000a\u000aNote: Some clips and images may have been blurred or removed to avoid copyright infringement. \u000a\u000a* See all the UCLA German 59: Holocaust in Film and Literature classes in this series: http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=E162D5967A29AA3B\u000a* See more courses from UCLA: http://www.youtube.com/uclacourses\u000a* See more from UCLA's main channel on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/ucla

This generous fund has enabled us to establish a tradition of poetry on campus to celebrate the works of renowned and rising contemporary poets, and provide an opportunity for graduate student poets from the UC Berkeley campus community to introduce and read alongside a featured poet.\u000a\u000aEach academic year the Holloway Series honors one distinguished poet with a residency at the University of California, Berkeley, formally known as the Holloway Lectureship in the Practice of Poetry. Residents teach a semester-long creative writing workshop, are welcomed in the annual fall faculty poetry reading, and give a featured reading in the Holloway Series.\u000aFor a schedule of upcoming events and information, visit: http://holloway.english.berkeley.edu/\u000a\u000aSponsor:Department of English

VThe Science Behind the Bike
p18633
aVThe Science Behind the Bike is a series of films that investigate how science and technology have transformed the sport of cycling. We talk to Olympic gold-medallists Chris Boardman and Rebecca Romero, and Paralympian gold-medallist Sarah Storey, take a trip to a wind tunnel, consult with Team GB physiologists and hear from design experts and cycling legends such as Graeme Obree and Francesco Moser. In this series you will find out about the legendary Hour Record (the record for the longest distance cycled in one hour), learn about technology, discover the forces that have to be overcome to ride fast and understand how the body deals physiologically when riding at Olympic level.\u000a\u000aThis material was produced to support the Open University module S172 Sport: the science behind the medals.

VMIT Understanding Lasers and Fiberoptics
p18727
aVLasers are essential to an incredibly large number of applications. Today, they are used in bar code readers, compact discs, medicine, communications, sensors, materials processing, computer printers, data processing, 3D-imaging, spectroscopy, navigation, non-destructive testing, chemical processing, color copiers, laser "shows", and in the military. There is hardly a field untouched by the laser. But what exactly is so unique about lasers that makes them so effective?\u000a\u000aThis brief video course is designed for engineers, scientists, medical personnel, managers, and others who work with lasers and/or fiberoptics, or who anticipate working with lasers and/or fiberoptics, yet have little or no background in laser or fiberoptic basics. The course focuses on fundamentals and emphasizes a physical intuitive interpretation of laser and fiberoptic phenomena and their applications. Because Prof. Ezekiel keeps mathematics to a minimum, the topics covered are easily understood, without the need for a strong technical background. Prof. Ezekiel uses plain language, graphic illustrations, and video demonstrations to explain the basic characteristics of lasers and fiberoptics.

aVWhat is type 1 diabetes? How do people with diabetes manage their symptoms? Type 1 diabetes occurs when insulin producing cells are destroyed, and the body can no longer produce the insulin needed to control sugar levels in the blood.  It can develop at any age, but most commonly emerges in childhood.  Diabetics must ensure that they don't have too much or too little sugar in their blood as either extreme can cause medical complications. In this collection, 21-year old Clemmy reveals what it is like to have high blood sugar, and 22-year old Sam shares his experiences of dealing with low levels of blood sugar.

VMIT Understanding Lasers and Fiberoptics
p19292
aVLasers are essential to an incredibly large number of applications. Today, they are used in bar code readers, compact discs, medicine, communications, sensors, materials processing, computer printers, data processing, 3D-imaging, spectroscopy, navigation, non-destructive testing, chemical processing, color copiers, laser "shows", and in the military. There is hardly a field untouched by the laser. But what exactly is so unique about lasers that makes them so effective?\u000a\u000aThis brief video course is designed for engineers, scientists, medical personnel, managers, and others who work with lasers and/or fiberoptics, or who anticipate working with lasers and/or fiberoptics, yet have little or no background in laser or fiberoptic basics. The course focuses on fundamentals and emphasizes a physical intuitive interpretation of laser and fiberoptic phenomena and their applications. Because Prof. Ezekiel keeps mathematics to a minimum, the topics covered are easily understood, without the need for a strong technical background. Prof. Ezekiel uses plain language, graphic illustrations, and video demonstrations to explain the basic characteristics of lasers and fiberoptics.

VIslamic Norms in Secular Public Spheres Conference
p19743
aVIslamic Norms in Secular Public Spheres Conference: political problems, legal issues, and social practices\u000aUC Berkeley, May 7th-8th 2009\u000a\u000aThe issue of Islamic norms in the public sphere came recently forward in non-Muslim and Muslim societies. It was raised about specific cases including the call to establish an Islamic arbitration court in Ontario following the model of the rabbinic court, the declaration of Dr Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, about the possibility of recognizing non-Christian courts (ie sharia courts) to decide certain matters of family law, the refusal by Minneapolis Somali taxi drivers to take passengers carrying alcohol, the annulment of a marriage in France because the wife was not a virgin, or last but not least the failed endeavour to vote an adultery law in Turkey. Other examples could be added to this non-exhaustive list. Recognizing Islamic courts as suggested by the public statements by the Archbishop of Canterbury raises many questions that touch upon different scales of analysis and imply an interdisciplinary and comparative focus on the various related sub-themes. Interestingly, this going public dynamic of Islamic norms correspond to an intensification of discussion over religious rights of individuals living in secular contexts.\u000a\u000aThis conference proposal entitled Islamic norms in secular public spheres: political problems, legal issues, and social practices aims at merging the two dynamics, on the one hand the judicialisation of religion related disputes in secular contexts, and on the other one the de-judicialisation of a religion based set of norms often designated under the label of sharia.  By focusing on Muslims and Islam as core object of study, we do not have in mind to consider it as exceptional. On the contrary, this conference wishes to widen the scope of traditional strategies of research on Islam and Muslims by inviting experts of other religious groups (Jews, Sikhs in particular) to confront their expertise.\u000a\u000aCo-sponsors: The Robert Schuman Centre, The Carnegie Corporation, The Graduate Theological Union, The Institute of Slavic, Eastern European and Eurasian Studies, Chaire de recherche du Canada en etude du pluralisme religieux et de l'ethnicite (CRSH/Universite de Montreal) \u000a\u000ahttp://igov.berkeley.edu/\u000aSponsor:Institutions and Governance Program

VAlan Turing Centenary Lectures
p19927
aV2012 marks the centenary of the birth of Alan Turing, an event being celebrated worldwide. Turing is regarded by many as the originator of modern computing. His work had a strong influence in several fields: mathematics, logic, cryptology and morphogenesis, but it is perhaps in the field of computer science that his legacy has been the most profound. The University of Edinburgh and the Royal Society of Edinburgh present a series of lectures celebrating his achievements and reflecting on the impact of his work on modern life.

p19961
aVThink how things have changed in the last fifty years. Societies are more multicultural, family structures are more fluid, employment is more mobile and transient. And while the gap between the rich and the poor may have widened, the great divide between generations seems to have narrowed. Sociology explores how societies develop and the compelling forces that shape our behaviour, values and identity. It can be found under Social Sciences. http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/qualification/social-sciences/index.htm

VCourse | Geography of United States Elections
p20008
aVStarting on October 15, you can follow a timely course being presented by Stanford University. Led by Martin Lewis, this map-intensive course will explore the geography of US elections (both past and present), and challenge the suggestion that we are simply divided into a Red America and Blue America. Its really much more complicated than that.\u000a\u000aOffered by Stanfords Continuing Studies program, the course will last five weeks, and include a debrief after the presidential election. A new lecture will be posted each Wednesday.
